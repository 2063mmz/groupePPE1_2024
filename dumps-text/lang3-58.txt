People Are Paying ₹350 To Eat A Half Slice Of Sweet Potato In Japan That Is
Slow Roasted For 3 Hours; Here’s Why

Satsumaimo or Japanese sweet potatoes are slow-roasted in traditional clay
ovens for almost three hours and have a smokey, sweet taste.

The good ol’ sweet potato, often called shakarkandi, is a winter staple
in India. It’s delicious, versatile, and easy on the pocket. So,
imagine our surprise when we got to know that people are paying almost
₹350 for half a slice of sweet potato in Japan. Scroll on to know why
people are readily paying this massive amount of money for this comfort
dish.

₹350 For A Half Slice Of Sweet Potato In Japan

Food blogger Karan Marwah recently had the “most luxurious slow-roasted
sweet potato” experience of his life in Japan recently. During his
trip, he visited the vibrant and upscale district of Ginza in Tokyo.
While strolling around the market, he came across Tsubko Yakiimo, a
traditional sweet potato shop.

A post shared by Karan Marwah | FOODDelhi (@foodelhi)

In this shop, the sweet potatoes are sourced from some of the best of
the farms in Japan. Then, these premium sweet potatoes are slow-roasted
traditionally in big clay ovens. They are then slow-roasted for more
than three hours. This adds a smokey flavour to the melt-in-mouth sweet
potatoes which are called ‘satsumaimo’.

For half a slice of these satsumaimo, Karan paid ¥650, which is almost
equivalent to ₹350. Seeing the price, many people in the comments
section were flabbergasted, while others were so taken by the way it
was roasted that they wanted to visit Japan just to try it out!

More About Satsumaimo & Its Benefits

Satsumaimo or Japanese sweet potatoes are quite popular among locals.
In fact, there are special expos held in cities like Osaka, Kanagawa,
Shimane, and Aichi for this vegetable. When slow-roasted for long
hours, the natural sugar in sweet potatoes caramelises and gives it a
smokey, sweet flavour, without forgoing its health benefits. Satsumaimo
is also a natural fibre supplement. It is rich in vitamins C and E and
can help prevent obesity, prevent digestive system diseases, and even
strokes. All this makes it a great vegetable to add to meals.

Take this as your sign to bake and enjoy sweet potato at home right
away! And, if you plan to visit Japan this year, make sure you try out
this delightful delicacy there.
