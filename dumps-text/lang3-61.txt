Recipe: Sweet Potato Pie Stuffed Biscuits

Alabama News Center | December 10, 2024 @ 1:25 pm

By: Andrea Mathis

I absolutely love sweet potatoes. I make sweet potato pancakes, sweet
potato fries, sweet potato smoothies, sweet potato muffins … (OK, now
I’m starting to sound like Bubba from “Forrest Gump”). My 1-year-old
son even had mashed sweet potatoes for lunch this week.

Keeping with the theme, I thought it was totally appropriate to make
Sweet Potato Pie Stuffed Biscuits. Sounds amazing, right? I love
homemade buttered biscuits, but I have zero time to make them, so I
often buy pre-made biscuits. My family loves them just the same and
they make my life a little easier.
