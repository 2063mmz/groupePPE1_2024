Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield surprised his offensive
linemen with quite the delicious gift this week.

Mayfield had personalized sugar cookies made with their jersey numbers
and names on it. He also gave them a huge glass of whole milk, which
really surprised a lot of the players. In a funny moment, offensive
tackle Tristan Wirfs even asked if the milk was "900 calories."

The players indulged in the cookies and the milk in the locker room. Of
course, the players had to dip the cookies in the milk glasses. They
really seemed to enjoy the cookies and couldn't stop thanking Mayfield
for the sweet gift.

The Buccaneers' social media account made a pun regarding the
situation, saying that "They call him Baker for a reason."

It's a tradition for NFL quarterbacks to purchase holiday gifts for
their offensive linemen, each of whom help guard their quarterback
throughout the season. Jalen Hurts gifted his with golf carts, while
Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson also gifted their offensive lineman
pretty sweet gifts.
