Abstract:We introduce a new measure of the structure of a liquid
which is the softness of the mean-field potential developed by us
earlier. We find that this softness is sensitive to small changes in
the structure. We then study its correlation with the supercooled
liquid dynamics. The study involves a wide range of liquids
(fragile, strong, attractive, repulsive, and active) and predicts
some universal behaviours like the softness is linearly proportional
to the temperature and inversely proportional to the activation
barrier of the dynamics with system dependent proportionality
constants. We write down a master equation between the dynamics and
the softness parameter and show that indeed the dynamics when scaled
by the temperature and system dependent parameters show a data
collapse when plotted against softness. The dynamics of fragile
liquids show a strong softness dependence whereas that of strong
liquids show a much weaker softness dependence. We also connect the
present study with the earlier studies of softness involving machine
learning (ML) thus providing a theoretical framework for
understanding the ML results.
