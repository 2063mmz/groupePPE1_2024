The Cultural Politics of Softness

Artist Lora Mathis was the first to spell it out for me: radical
softness can be used as a weapon. Their well-known piece, “Radical
Softness as a Weapon” showed these words surrounded by pearls, diamond
earrings, and knives. Though the piece began making the rounds on the
internet a few years ago, the interest in softness has continued to
circulate, and show up in sometimes unexpected places.

By softness I mean a general orientation to the world that foregrounds
vulnerability, emotionality, and earnestness. This stands in contrast
to hardness, an approach that often relies on irony and sarcasm to
shore up the image of infallible impenetrability. Hardness wants to
appear unattached and unaffected. Hardness wants to believe it can pull
itself up by the bootstraps. Hardness wants us to see this as strength.

The preference for hardness that prevails in many circles betrays a
hefty stake in the (neo)liberal myth of the autonomous, independent
subject. But many argue that acknowledging our vulnerability
foregrounds our actual interdependent human nature, rather than
pretending we could live without each other.

The shift to softness is multi-pronged; it can be charted through pop
music (from Katy Perry’s 2010-era party pop to Ariana Grande’s earnest
“thank u” to her ex-boyfriends), graphic design (Pantone’s dubbing
“rose quartz” and “serenity” the colours of the year in 2016), public
campaigns about mental health (like Bell’s (in)famous “Let’s Talk”),
and advertising (like Wonder Bread’s newest slogan, “The Power of
Softness”). But it is in queer, feminist politics that softness seems
to be rooted. Actually, because it stands in opposition to (neo)liberal
norms of rationality and independence, softness is an inherently queer,
feminist stance.

In recent years, there has been feminist backlash against the notion of
being “chill,” what author and activist Virgie Tovar describes as “an
environment where low expectations, low commitment, and zero
accountability are considered normal and, in fact, laudable.” Writer
Emma Pitman considers the attribute, “chill,” a paltry prize for a
woman’s “perceived indifference, complicity, and disinterest in holding
“‘chill’ actually sucks,” Pitman opts for the alternative: earnestness,
the only way she sees to cut through “Ironic Sexism.” “Instead of
valorising earnestness in the abstract, I’ll get literal and make the
vulnerable, uncool admission that ironic sexism hurts me,” she writes,
indeed shattering the image of impenetrability.

Feminist writer Jessica Valenti, too, seems to be tired of laughing it
off. In her memoir Sex Object, Valenti claims, “The feminism that’s
popular right now is largely grounded in using optimism and humour to
ourselves a disservice by working so hard to move past what sexism has
done to us rather than observe it for a while.”

For these writers, being earnest means honouring pain—especially that
instilled by sexism and patriarchy—and doing so is a way to construct
protective boundaries that work better than irony and humour ever
could. Irony offers no way to appeal to each other’s humanity; humour
doesn’t ask someone to be accountable for their actions. Both are
indirect, and at best simply offer commentary on the current situation
rather than demand its interruption. In contrast, softness means
admitting, “you hurt me,” but also, “I deserve better.”

Meanwhile, posts about tenderqueers and soft femmes have been
circulating on Tumblr since at least 2012, indicating a queer pull
towards the tender and soft, revealed by an inclination toward both
feelings and floral prints. The tenderqueer hashtag leads to text posts
about vulnerability, coping, and feelings, and selfies of queer and
non-binary people, often those with pastel hair and/or dapper outfits.
The soft femme hashtag yields more, and more varied, results, but hosts
a robust sample of shimmery pink outfits, florals, and pastel makeup.

In particular, the soft femme tag led me to artists like Starchild
Stela, whose art combines hyper-feminine imagery like baby animals,
bows, and doll-like figures with statements like, “non-binary and
bitter” or, “no pity for rapists.” Like Pitman’s suggested approach,
Stela holds nothing back, their messages are direct and honest—but
delivered in a pretty, feminized vehicle.

The aforementioned Mathis and Alok Vaid-Menon are other non-binary
artists that are well known for embracing vulnerability. Vaid-Menon’s
epic selfies are often captioned with candid descriptions of the
transmisogyny they are targeted by, that they refuse to be erased or
silenced by. Mathis’ illustrations and poetry frequently ruminate on
themes of past trauma and mental illness. Neither tries to hide their
emotional responses, but rather they strategically employ vulnerability
to raise political awareness about the social structures that enable
and perpetuate these painful experiences.

Their Instagram accounts also showcase contemporary queer aesthetics
that match those seen on Tumblr. It is not merely coincidental that
pastel-hued hair became popular alongside the impulse to get real about
our trauma and mental illness, to be honest about the emotional toll of
the oppressive structures we live in, or to call ourselves “tender” and
“soft.” Softness is both aesthetic and political, and aesthetics are
never separate from politics. That softness often looks pink and
flouncy, and feels vulnerable and emotional—in other words, that
softness is feminized—is not merely coincidental either.

The association of vulnerability with femininity and womanhood is part
of what makes it so uncomfortable to a patriarchal society. The turn to
softness, then, is an affront to patriarchal rule. It is evidence that
we are losing patience with the primacy of the individual, with the
fiction of independence. We are collapsing under the pressure to be
chill, to be detached—from both each other and our own humanity. We’re
using what has been feminized to chase out these hollow masculinist
principles that do not represent us or serve us.

Feminists and queers have always resisted problematic and oppressive
mainstream norms—it is their raison d’être, after all. They have long
been ready to supplant masculinist perspectives for feminist and femme
ones, to reconsider kinship and insist that how we relate to each other
matters, indeed, to admit that “the personal is political.” Femme
politics in particular are about reclaiming and revaluing what has been
discarded and dismissed for being feminine. The turn to softness
extends this political impulse by reclaiming and revaluing that which
is still seen as too mushy and too much: emotions, interdependence, and
caring—about anything.

The number of likes and followers steadily accumulating around
“abrasively feminine” and “aggressively vulnerable” content suggests
the currency of such an approach. Maybe someone else’s crying selfie
makes you feel less weird about crying; maybe someone else’s
description of their mental illness symptoms helps you seek therapy for
your own; maybe someone else’s account of harassment pushes you to
engage with others more thoughtfully; maybe sharing these posts among
friends helps us start important conversations, helps us learn to care
and advocate for each other better, helps us realize that we’re not
alone—and, importantly, that if we’re not alone, then maybe it’s not
us, maybe it’s the system.

This is the critical aspect that gets skipped over in the rush to
capitalize on the cultural turn to softness. Softness is not “showing
up” as a temporary, band-aid solution for superficial pain, it is
showing up, hoping to transform others and the entire socio-political
terrain with our radical honesty and vulnerability. In its queer and
feminist context, softness is the place from which we can build better
political principles, the place from which we can build a better world.

The turn to softness has ushered in new political sensibilities. We’re
no longer interested in pretending we can live without each other, or
pretending we don’t feel pain. Softness’ possibilities—like queer femme
healer Dacia Holliday’s promise that “we get to heal this lifetime”—are
appealing, so appealing that even the mainstream wants to explore them.
In short, the feminists and queers are winning the culture wars, if not
the political ones (at least, not yet), with superstars like Ariana
Grande and corporations like Wonder Bread the often unlikely
ambassadors.
