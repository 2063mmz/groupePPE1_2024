I have heard references to "hard" vs. "soft" analysis. What is the
difference? It seems to do with generality versus nitty-gritty
estimates, but I haven't gotten any responses more clear than that.

Disclaimer: I'm no expert-this is really a question for the analysts
and historians of mathematics.

As far as I know,the terminology came into existence in the early 20th
century distinguish the classical "calculus" type analysis (hard
analysis) from the new point set topology/functional analysis approach
(soft analysis). A hard analytic argument uses a direct calculation or
construction of an exact estimate bounds of specific function or
function types to prove a statement. A soft analytic arguement uses the
general topological or geometric properties of a space in which a
function or function class is defined to prove a result indirectly
without a precisely calculated "bound".

For example, the fact that the Cantor set has measure zero is a "hard"
analytic arguement; it uses an epsilon-delta arguement to show the
limit of the sequence of "slices" of the lengths of it's component
intervals on the real line converges to 0.

An example of a "soft" analytic arguement: (IVT) Let $f$ be a
continuous function defined on a connected subset of the real line i.e.
an interval with a well defined least upper bound and greatest lower
bound. Then the function is defined at every point inbetween the lub
and the glb. A soft proof would be as follows: Since an interval $I$ of
$\Bbb R$ is a connected subset of $\Bbb R$ and $f$ is continuous, then
$f(I)$ is also connected. Therefore, for every $x \in I$, $f(x)$ is in
$f(I)$. Notice this proof does not involve a direct computation of
bounds that proves $f(x)$ is in the image set of $f$ (although it
certainly COULD be proven that way).

Anyway, that's how Gerald Itzkowitz taught it to me and I learned a
long time ago to trust him on these matters........

$\begingroup$ I think that your answer about where the line is
drawn is good, but I would like to point out that Sobolev spaces
are in the realm of functional analysis but the various embedding
theorems are part of hard analysis. I think that is right. I
personally draw the line by seeing what i find appealing and what i
don't. Also, I think you have to get a bit deeper into the field
before you start to see the stark differences between the two, in
that the examples that best exemplify it are further down the
rabbit hole. I think you are right about the epsilon delta stuff
though. $\endgroup$

* $\begingroup$ I was not able to quickly find a reference, but I
remember that also Gaetano Fichera described the concept in the
same way in several historical papers on the mathematics (in Italy)
at the beginning of the 20th century. In particular, in the school
of Mauro Picone, the “hard analysis” approach was made concrete for
example in the emphasis on the explicit calculation of the
constants involved in a priori estimates for PDEs, due to their
importance for the construction of solutions. $\endgroup$

A historical note.

Hermann Weyl mentioned in his talk "Felix Kleins Stellung in der
mathematischen Gegenwart" that the dichotomy of "hard vs. soft
analysis" had been suggested by Hardy. According to Hardy, there is the
function theory of the "hard, sharp, narrow" kind (due to Bohr, Landau
or Littlewood) as opposed to the "soft, large, vague" kind (due to
Birkhoff or Koebe).

Edit. Apparently, Hardy's musings are contained in his paper
"Prolegomena To a Chapter on Inequalities" (unfortunately, I don't have
access to it at the moment).

Edit 2. Indeed, here's the quotation from Hardy's paper.

A thorough mastery of elementary inequalities is to-day one of the
first necessary qualifications for research in the theory of
functions; at any rate, in function theory of the "hard, sharp,
narrow" kind as opposed to the "soft, large, vague" kind (I do not
use any of these adjectives as words either of praise or blame), the
function-theory of Bohr, Landau, or Littlewood, as opposed to the
function-theory of Birkhoff or Koebe. It is essential to anyone
working in this field to be master both of the main results and of
the tricks of the trade.

$\begingroup$ To be honest, I am quite puzzled by the fact that
usage of the word barbarous in its meaning in a language I don't
understand (originally, in a language which is not Greek, later,
not in Greek nor in Latin, and so on...) could rise such opposition
as evinced by the upvotes on Alex's initial comment---which can
only be understood as downvotes on mine. I don't expect anyone to
catch a jokingly reference to Herodotus, but what do people really
find so downvotable? $\endgroup$
– Mariano Suárez-Álvarez
Commented Nov 21, 2010 at 2:20
$\begingroup$ Mariano, the most likely reason people find your
comment downvotable is that barbarous is essentially a synonym for
barbaric in English, i.e. savage, violent, cruel, brutal,
uncivilized, and uncultured. So, the obvious interpretation of your
statement is something to the effect of "wouldn't it be nice if
someone translated that ugly German text into a language actually
spoken by civilized people?" I assume this was not your intention,
of course! It is also somewhat common for people to say that German
is an ugly language, probably a sentiment that has carried over
from the 1940s. $\endgroup$

Consider the problem of shuffling a deck of cards using some shuffling
technique. One may wonder, "If I use this or that shuffling technique,
will I shuffle the deck?" The problem can be transferred to a question
of whether a particular finite Markov process converges to the uniform
distribution or not. Omitting some details, a classical theorem says
that, yes, the process will converge (to the uniform distribution) as
long as your technique is reasonable. Not only that, the convergence
will eventually be exponential. This seems like a useful theorem, but
it is actually rather deficient. The problem is that your practical
side may wonder how many shuffles are required to get the deck
reasonably randomized, and this theorem doesn't help. So you might say
that the original analysis was soft because the result does not help in
solving this quantitative problem. It tells you that shuffling is a
good idea, but it doesn't give you any clue whether a given technique
could shuffle the deck in your lifetime or not. A hard analysis would
tell you, for example, "If one defines reasonably randomized by measure
blahblah, then $2\log_2(52)$ riffle shuffles are sufficient to
randomize the deck."

* $\begingroup$ A probablistic arguement is a good idea,Peter-but I'm
not sure if as it stands it'll fly. Any of the probablists or
analysts in the room want to chime in on this? $\endgroup$

Commented Nov 20, 2010 at 18:25
* $\begingroup$ I'm not exactly sure what you mean that this is a
probabilistic argument. One can phrase it in a probabilistic way,
but really it boils down to a hard linear algebra problem since the
Markov process has finitely many states (the measures here are just
vectors/functions). The statement that convergence happens is just
the Perron-Frobenius Theorem. It is rather convenient to use
probabilistic methods in the hard analysis of shuffling, though. I
think this example rather clearly demonstrates the struggle between
generality and quantitativeness. By the way, I myself happen to be
an analyst... $\endgroup$

Cantor sets, then. I would expand the ternary Cantor set by a factor of
three, note that this makes two disjoint copies, and conclude the
measure was zero that way. A "soft" argument indeed. That does make the
point that "facts" need not belong to hard or soft varieties; arguments
may do. Other Cantor sets don't have the exact structure to carry out
the enlargement. So you need a "hard" argument to include them, at
least on the face of it.

$\begingroup$ To quote Andrew L: the fact that the Cantor set has
measure zero is a "hard" analytic argument. That is something I
contest in two ways. Firstly, the fact is not either "hard" or
"soft". Second, the argument I sketch by enlarging the ternary
Cantor set is what I'd call "soft" since it is based on
self-similarity. As I mentioned, there are other Cantor sets and
self-similarity doesn't work directly for those; and at this point
an "epsilon-delta" or at least "let epsilon > 0" argument may be
the obvious way to proceed. $\endgroup$

Commented Nov 21, 2010 at 8:41
* $\begingroup$ A hard argument for this would give more: For any
integer k calculate integers m, n with km<n such that the Cantor
set is covered by fewer than m intervals all of length 1/n.
