I Luv C. reviewed True Scottish Shortbread
I love this recipe and have been using it for years. Everyone oohs and
aahs over the shortbread. This year I finally tweaked it and made
rosemary hazelnut. I substituted 1/3 of the flour for hazelnut flour
and added about a TBSP of finely chopped rosemary. I added extra
necessary flour (quite a bit) while kneading but they turned out great.
