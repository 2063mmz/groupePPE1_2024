A Reddit post went viral after a user shared a restaurant bill that
included a 5% gratuity charge, sparking widespread debate. The
anonymous user questioned whether this “gratuity” charge had been
around for a while.

The bill shows that the customer ordered multiple types of Chinese
food, pizza, and soft drinks. The restaurant, named Cafe 24, charged
state and central GST at 9%, amounting to Rs 746.58 each.

However, the shocking part was the additional 5% gratuity charge on the
entire bill, which amounted to Rs 395. The total bill for the customer
came to Rs 9,788. Following the post, it went viral, garnering over
2,000 likes and nearly 400 comments.

“No, ask them to remove it. Charging 5% on the bill amount and calling
it gratuity is crazy; it should be classified as robbery,” said one
social media user. Another added, “It’s basically a tip that they’ve
added on your behalf. You can ask them to remove it, and they are
legally required to do so. If they do not remove it, you can take legal
action.”

Social media users also commented on the “Rs 40 Pepsi charged at Rs
200,” pointing out that the bill showed four quantities of Pepsi
costing around Rs 800.
