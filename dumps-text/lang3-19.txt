Feel of the fabrics to the skin or hand
clothing: headband, cap, fur-lined coat, scarf and sweater

Hand feel (Hand, Fabric hand, Fabric feel) is the property of fabrics
related to the touch that expresses sensory comfort. It refers to the
way fabrics feel against the skin or in the hand and conveys
information about the cloth's softness and smoothness. Hand feel is an
estimated and subjective property of different fabrics, but nowadays,

Handle


This terminology was commonly used in relation to wool, referred to as
a 'wool term,' or in the broader textile industry to describe
characteristics that contribute to its quality, including softness,

When evaluating the quality of woven fabrics, the attribute of "handle"
severity, softness, and smoothness, which are also assessed through

Tactile senses


Our daily life experiences are profoundly influenced by the sense of
touch. Touch is the first sense to develop, beginning in the first
trimester of pregnancy. During the next few months in the womb, the
baby's entire body develops touch receptors. Around 7 weeks into
pregnancy, touch is the first sense to develop in the
of clothing that provides sensory comfort.

characteristics that are necessary for sensory comfort that is related
clothes and the body. It is associated with smoothness, roughness,
softness, and stiffness of clothing material. The degree of tactile
discomfort may vary with individuals. Some of the terms that describe
the tactile sensations are clingy, sticky, scratchy, prickly, soft,

Terms


There are different terms in use for describing the softness of textile
materials. Wool trade term for the same is ''Handle'' or ''A good
handling''. The opposing term is 'A poor handling' that suggests the

Objective


Fabrics during manufacturing becomes harsh that is undesirable hence
they are made soft again for end users or useful input materials for
fabrics for a particular category or line; for instance, softer clothes
are preferred for children. Ladies' clothes are designed with lighter

Softening and stiffening


Softening finishes are aimed to make materials, soft, in against to
that stiffening finishes are intended to make materials, stiff in order
to prevent sagging. Stiffening adds crispiness to the light sheer
fabrics. Stiffening involves the application of thermoplastic resins
and polymers. Parchmentising is a kind of finish that stiffens the

More objectives of hand feel are:

Fabric drape


Drape (draping or fabric drape) is the property of different textile
materials how they fold, fall, or hang along with a three-dimensional
body. Draping depends upon the fiber characteristics and the
flexibility, looseness, and softness of the material.Drape finishes can

Loft


Hand feel adds compression resiliency; Soft fabrics tend to spring back

Sewability


Soft fabrics are more compatible in sewing. Softness improves the
selling the goods and comfort but also aid in sewing (avoids stitching

Factors


Hand feel may vary with the composition, various yarn parameters (such
as hairiness, twist and yarn count), and gsm (fabric weight), and

The judgement of fabrics on the scale of soft to harsh is affected by
the following parameters.

Fiber properties and yarn


The staple length and diameter of the constituting fibers affect the
softness of the materials. More considerable fiber length needs less
twisting, and loosely twisted yarns tend to have a softer hand feel.
Examples are egyptian, and pima cotton is softer than cotton with
shorter fibers. The same is with Silk, and synthetic fibers that have

Texture


The concept of texture pertains to the characteristics of a fabric's
surface and can be discerned through both visual and tactile
perceptions. The texture of a fabric may be either smooth or rough. As
natural fibers are characterized by inherent variations, they tend to
imbue fabrics with greater texture compared to their synthetic or
manufactured counterparts. The texture of a fabric is also greatly
influenced by factors such as yarn type, finishing techniques, and

Surface contour


The surface contour of the fiber characterizes its outer surface along
its shaft and may be rough, smooth, scaly, serrated, convoluted, or
striated, all of which contribute to the friction, softness, and
texture. The property is important for the texture and hand feel of the

Fabric construction and thickness


The fabric construction and thickness of the cloth can present harsh or
soft handfeel. Usually, the fine and lightweight structures with loose
weave or knit constructions are more delicate until the twisted or
textured yarns are not used. On the other hand, heavy, and thicker
fabrics could be soft or harsh depending upon the after treatments and

Process


The feel of some fabrics like silk (satin), fine muslins (mulmul),
rayon (modal or lyocell), nylon and microfibers' fabrics are naturally
soft. Still, in large, it is manipulated with different processes and
finishing techniques. Fabric softeners and certain surface finishes

Fabric softeners


Fabric softeners are substances that aid in the softening, durability,
and drape of fabrics. Softeners also help in providing body to the
fabrics and they facilitate other finishing processes, such as wrinkle
resistance finish where fabrics become stiffened due to the finish.
Silicone compounds, substituted ammonium compounds, fats, wax

Surface finishes


Surface finishes are the treatments that alter the surface and feel of
the textiles. They include several mechanical and chemical
applications.

Mechanical


Napping


Napping or Raising produces a soft and fibrous surface, it is a
mechanical finish. A machine equipped with metallic wires that breaks
the yarns and creates a fibrous surface on the surface.

Sueding


Sueding is a similar finish to napping, but it's a delicate finish; the

Shearing


Shearing improves the appearance and feel of the fabric by cutting the

Chemical

Main article: Chemical finishing of textiles

Mercerizing


Mercerizing improves the characteristics of the cellulosic materials
and improves the feel and aesthetics of the treated fabrics.

Deweighting


Deweighting, or weight reduction, is a treatment for polyester to make
it like silk. The treatment peels the surface and reduces the fiber
weight and strength while making them softer and finer. Additionally,

Bio polishing


Bio polishing or Enzyme wash is applicable in cellulosic fibers; it is
a cellulase enzyme treatment that helps cut protruding fibers and

Functional finishes


Moisture wicking is an example of functional finish that enhances the
wearer's comfort.

Testing


So far, hand feel has been a subjectively judged parameter based on
manual touch. But now, there are hand feel testers that can evaluate
the quality with parameters of bending, roughness, compression, and

Tests


One of the instrumental test methods is  "AATCC TM 202:2014," which
measures the "feels and looks" similar to manual sensory

Kawabata evaluation system


The Kawabata evaluation system predicts human responses and understands
the perception of softness. Additionally, it can be used to determine
the transient heat transfer properties associated with the sensation of
coolness generated when fabrics come into contact with the skin while

Interactive touch-activated display


The interactive touch-activated display, also known as the "iTad," is a
device equipped with multitouch sensing that can help feel images on a

How different fabrics feel when someone judges them manually


Manually evaluating the fabric's feel is subjective. Perceptions of
different people may differ. Skillful assessment may require experience
in the handling of different fabrics. Thermal conductivity also plays a
role in how different fabrics feel.
* Cotton, linen, and rayon are good conductors of heat. The heat from
the finger may be lost on touching while judging. Thus, these
fibers "feel cool to the touch."
* Wool feels warm as it is not a good conductor of heat. The heat is
not lost when someone puts his/her finger on the fabric of wool, it
remains there and that is why the wool feels warm. Wool has
elasticity and is springy as well.
