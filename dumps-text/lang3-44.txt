WARNING: Spoilers for Squid Game season 2 and Sweet Home.

No-eul’s connection to the little girl who has cancer was arguably the
saddest story in Squid Game season 2, yet it was also a stealth Sweet
Home reunion. While Squid Game season 1 became Netflix’s most-watched
show of all time, it was not the first K-drama to be a worldwide hit
for the streamer. A year earlier, Sweet Home became the first Korean
show to appear on Netflix’s global top 10 and opened the door for more
original K-dramas on the platform. Although Sweet Home and Squid Game
are very different shows, they share some similarities.

Just like Squid Game, Sweet Home season 2 also took three years to
arrive after a very successful first season. Likewise, Sweet Home
produced seasons 2 and 3 back-to-back, with the third and final season
arriving less than a year later. This is exactly what is happening with
Squid Game season 3. Another similarity is the themes of survival and
teamwork, although Squid Game is a much more grounded show than Sweet
Home. Lastly, Squid Game and Sweet Home share some actors, with Park
Gyu-young and Lee Jin-wook playing key roles in both shows.

They Played No-eul And Gyeong-seok In Squid Game Season 2


No-eul and Gyeong-seok’s story in Squid Game season 2 was a small Sweet
Home reunion. Before starring in Squid Game, Park Gyu-young broke big
as Yoon Ji-su in Sweet Home’s seasons 1 and 2. While Netflix’s Sweet
Home made some big changes to the webtoon on which the K-drama was
based, including the relationship between Ji-su and Cha Hyun-su, Park
Gyu-young’s character was one of the best things about the show.
Unfortunately, Ji-su’s story was cut short in Sweet Home season 2, with
Park Gyu-young not returning for season 3.

Lee Jin-wook, who plays Gyeong-seok (Player 246) in Squid Game season
2, also starred in Sweet Home, having played more than one character on
the show. In the first season, Lee played the anti-hero Sang-wook.
Although Sang-wook died at the end of season 1, his body was inhabited
by a different character. This made it so that Lee Jin-wook could
return in Sweet Home season 2 as Nam Sang-woon, whose monster powers
allowed him to switch bodies. While Park Gyu-young and Lee Jin-wook’s
characters in Squid Game don’t actually interact much in season 2,
their stories are heavily connected.

Squid Game season 2, episode 2 spends a lot of time with Park
Gyu-young’s character and makes us character about her. In addition to
a difficult life on its own – No-eul is living by herself in South
Korea while trying to find her daughter who stayed behind in North
Korea – she is also friends with a little girl who has cancer. Na-yeon
giving No-eul a drawing of her and the pink bunny was the most
wholesome moment in season 2, yet it was the prelude of what could be a
tragic story.

No-eul had to watch Gyeong-seok playing the games knowing that he could
be eliminated and killed at any time.

In what was perhaps the biggest plot twist of the season, Park
Gyu-young was not playing another contestant in Squid Game season 2 but
rather one of the pink guards. To make things more complicated,
Na-yeon’s father, Gyeong-seok, joined the games as one of the
contestants to pay for his daughter’s experimental cancer treatment.
No-eul had to watch Gyeong-seok playing the games knowing that he could
be eliminated and killed at any time, which would leave the girl
without a father and with no one to provide for her.

Did Gyeong-seok Really Die In Squid Game Season 2?

Gyeong-seok was one of the contestants who joined Gi-hun’s rebellion in
Squid Game season 2’s finale and remained in the hallway through all of
the shooting. However, with Dae-ho and Hyun-ju never coming back with
more ammunition and the Front Man killing everyone on the other side
but Gi-hun, the ones who stayed behind were doomed to fail. While they
tried to surrender, the pink guards were taking no prisoners and shot
all of the remaining insurgents. This includes Gyeong-seok, who asked
for mercy and said he had a daughter.

Park Gyu-young’s Squid Game Season 2 Role Was So Much Better Than What Anyone
Could’ve Expected

Park Gyu-young's presence in Squid Game season 2 was certainly
exciting, but her surprising role (and potential) was even better than
expected.
Posts

While we see a triangle guard shoot Gyeong-seok, we don’t actually see
where he was shot and what happened to him afterward. It can be assumed
that Gyeong-seok was shot dead, but there is a chance he is still
alive. The only way Gyeong-seok survived is if the triangle guard who
shot him was No-eul, who may have chosen to spare his life. If so, Park
Gyu-young’s character could be willing to break the rules and even
fight her bosses in Squid Game season 3 to save Na-yeon’s father.

In Squid Game, a mysterious invitation to join a competition is
sent to people at risk who are in dire need of money. Four hundred
fifty-six participants from all walks of life are locked into a
secret location where they play games to win 45.6 billion won.
Games are selected from traditional Korean children's games, such
as Red Light and Green Light, but the consequence of losing is
death. To survive, competitors must choose their alliances
carefully - but the further they go in the competition, the more
likely betrayal will rear its ugly head.
