Santa Cruz, Bolivia – In the heart of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, a charming
little pastry shop is delighting locals with a taste of France. Les
Petits Macarons, the dream come true of Honduran migrant Zamantha, has
quickly become a beloved spot for anyone craving the satisfying taste
of macarons.

Stepping into the shop, customers are enveloped in the irresistible
aroma of freshly baked macarons. These delicate, meringue-based treats
are brightly coloured and elegantly displayed against a backdrop of
soft pastels and graceful chandeliers, evoking the enchanting
atmosphere of cozy Parisian patisseries. "Each bite takes you on a
journey to romantic Paris," Zamantha says with convincing enthusiasm.

For Zamantha, 31, running this entrepreneurship means more than a
business, it is a dream blossomed during her travels across Europe. Her
journey from Honduras to Bolivia was sparked by love – a serendipitous
romance that prompted her to embark on a gradual process of starting
anew in a new land in 2019. Since opening her pastry shop in 2023, she
has devoted herself into sharing the joy of macarons with her new
community.

Juggling the demands of raising two young children while nurturing her
growing business, Zamantha’s arrival in Bolivia also meant navigating
unfamiliar customs and culture. “It is not always a walk in the park,
but it is so rewarding,” she says. “I want my children to understand
that no matter where you come from, hard work can help you build the
life you dream of.”

Zamantha’s menu features a range of flavours from timeless raspberry to
unique seasonal specialities crafted with local ingredients, adapted to
local taste. With Christmas around the corner, she is preparing festive
macarons shaped like miniature Christmas trees, adding a touch of
holiday magic to her offerings.

The response from customers has been overwhelmingly positive, as locals
eagerly embrace these sweet confections. "They are absolutely
delicious. I haven’t tasted anything this good in ages," raves Teresa,
a Bolivian customer who has become a regular.

Zamantha’s creations showcase her culinary talent and are an
introduction to many who may be new to these French delicacies. “I love
showing to them the real thing,” she smiles, highlighting the
differences between macarons and similar treats like
Argentine alfajores.

Still, Zamantha’s journey has not been without its bumps. As a migrant
starting from scratch, she has faced many challenges but tackled each
one with determination and positivity. The International Organization
for Migration (IOM) has played a crucial role in her success, helping
her navigate her entrepreneurial path. "The potential of migrants is
truly limitless," says Pamela Fernandez, IOM Head of Office in Bolivia.
"Their talents can be a significant lift to local economies."

IOM supported 117 migrants in Bolivia to establish and strengthen their
businesses in 2023 and 2024. This initiative includes business
management and soft skills, technical support for business plans, and
essential equipment. “By fostering sustainable livelihoods, we empower
migrants to integrate into the workforce and contribute to the
socio-economic development of their host communities,” adds Pamela.

At FEXPOCRUZ, South America’s largest international fair, Zamantha
enthusiastically shares her macarons with a global audience, eager to
seize every opportunity for growth. "Every conversation is a precious
opportunity, every event a chance to share my vision," she says. Thanks
to the new partnerships with local businesses, her sales have recently
jumped by an impressive 30 per cent.

Through Les Petis Macarons, Zamantha has successfully introduced a
taste of France to Bolivia, creating a community for fellow sweet
lovers with the universal language of food. “This shop is my way of
saying that I am here, and I am proud to call this place home,” she
affirms, highlighting her commitment to both her roots and her new
life.
