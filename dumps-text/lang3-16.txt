blow in the decade’s best soft sounds.

addition to its group of Keweenaw Peninsula radio stations, provided
the community with the background music for a fantastic Thanksgiving,
Christmas, and New Year’s Eve. When the chook drops on Houghton’s
waterfront at midnight The Breeze will begin to play music from artists
like Cyndi Lauper, Whitney Houston, James Taylor, Phil Collins, Adele,
and Taylor Swift.


WHBS will continue to feature Queen Bee’s Knees’ Keweenaw Report news
and sports broadcasts, What’s Happening community calendar updates, and
funeral announcements. Advertisers interested in learning how
Houghton’s Breeze can add to existing campaigns with our stations
