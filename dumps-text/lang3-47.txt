Nancy McKeon Posts Sweet Tribute After Colleague’s Death

Entertainer Nancy McKeon shared a beautiful message on social media
after learning of a colleague’s death.

McKeon is known by many of her fans for her time on “The Facts of
Life,” but others recall seeing her in Hallmark projects such as “Wild
Hearts” or “Love Begins.”

She also competed on season 27 of “Dancing with the Stars” where she
partnered with Val Chmerkovskiy.

The message McKeon shared on social media came in response to the death
of Linda Lavin. On December 30, the New York Times reported that Levin
died at the age of 87 on December 29.

The New York Times noted that Lavin starred in the television sitcom
“Alice” from 1976 to 1985. While she appeared on Broadway and in many
other projects over the years as well, many fans remembered her
primarily from “Alice.”

She also starred in the 1998 Hallmark Hall of Fame movie “Best Friends
for Life” with Gena Rowlands.

McKeon’s brother, Philip McKeon, played “Tommy,” Lavin’s son on
“Alice.” He died in December 2019, reported People, after dealing with
a longtime illness.

After Lavin’s death, Nancy McKeon shared a couple of old photos from
the show “Alice” on her Instagram page. Both pictures showed her
brother with Levin.

McKeon’s caption was beautiful yet simple. “…💔rest in peace Linda…look
after each other. 💙🕊️”

McKeon’s fans loved the tribute she posted and the beautiful connection
between Philip McKeon and Lavin.

“My deepest condolences to you Nancy. Linda will look out for your
brother. Rest In Peace to Linda and Philip, ❤️🕊️❤️🕊️❤️” wrote one
Instagram user.

“Sweet Nancy! This is exactly what I was thinking. You are the only one
that could say it. I know it’s a sweet reunion,” commented another
supporter.

“Just heard about this and thought about you immediately,” shared
someone else.

Another comment read, “Alice and Tommy~ just posted the original
opening song/video to ALICE~ seeing those two together hit my heart~
💔Rest in Peace Linda Lavin~ 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢”

“Such a loss as well as your brother. I adored them both on Alice. May
they rest in peace together, 😢🙏🏼🙏🏼” wrote a separate Instagram user.

Shortly before her brother died in 2019, McKeon shared a photo and
sweet caption about him on Instagram for his birthday. She wrote, “It’s
been a tough time lately… but as we’ve always said…we’ll get through it
together…love you Dude.”
