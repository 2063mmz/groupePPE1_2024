Last year, in 2024, Sweet Grown Alabama, the state’s official
agricultural branding program, marked significant growth, fueled by new
grants. The initiative received over $200,000 in funding to support
local farmers and producers, helping expand the program’s reach across
the state.

Sweet Grown Alabama works to promote Alabama-grown products by
connecting farmers with businesses, retailers, and consumers. With this
new funding, the program is enhancing marketing efforts, increasing
awareness, and encouraging more farmers to participate. One of the key
focuses is boosting the production and sale of locally grown products
by improving visibility and consumer engagement.

As Alabama’s farming community continues to grow, Sweet Grown Alabama
is providing valuable resources to help farmers thrive, strengthening
the state’s agricultural economy. This initiative shows how grant
funding can create real opportunities for rural farmers and businesses.

To learn more about how to get involved, apply for grants, or mimic
