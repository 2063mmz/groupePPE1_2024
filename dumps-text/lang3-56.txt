SCRANTON, LACKAWANNA CO. (WOLF) — The Lackawanna County Children’s
Library is making science fun for kids with its Curiosity Club, a free
STEM program for preschool to third-grade students. Today, young
scientists explored the sweet science of candy canes in a hands-on
learning experience.

Kids experimented with baking soda and vinegar to make candy canes
“dance,” tested how different liquids dissolve the sweet treats, and
even learned whether candy canes sink or float.

“This is a program that anybody can come in; they don’t need to pay
anything. We know that a lot of schools don’t always offer things that
they used to anymore, so this is an opportunity for kids to learn
different things that they might not get to in school in a fun way,"
said Jenna O'Malley, early childhood program coordinator at Lackawanna
Children's Library.

The classes are every fourth Saturday of the month, requiring only a
library card. Next month, the Curiosity Club will dive into the
freezing points of water, with kids trying their hand at indoor ice
fishing.
