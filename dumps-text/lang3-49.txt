Justin Bieber dedicated a sweet tribute to his wife Hailey Bieber in
his New Year's Day post.

On Wednesday, the 30-year-old singer shared a photo of his wife's
NYE-themed outfit and admired her incredible post-baby bikini body.

In his short but sweet caption, he swooned over her and also
effectively shut down ongoing speculation that he and his wife were
headed for divorce.

'Um. Goin anywhere with u bb,' he wrote over the photo. 'Happy new
year.'

His post comes just shortly after Hailey shared her own New Year's Eve
party wrap — which included a photo of caviar-topped In-N-Out burger as
well as a snapshot of their baby boy's foot.

The couple — who have been married since 2018 and became first-time
parents earlier this year — welcomed their son, Jack Blues Bieber, in
August.

In recent weeks, the new parents sparked divorce rumors when trolls
started speculating that they were subtweeting each other via Instagram
Stories.

Social media users started speculating, yet again, that they had split
or were going through a rough patch on the heels of his ex-girlfriend
Selena Gomez's engagement.

On December 11, the actress, 32, happily announced her engagement to
Benny Blanco after only a year-and-a-half of dating.

As for Hailey and Justin's marriage, a source close to the couple said
they're 'more in love than ever.'

'Hailey has seen a whole different side to Justin since becoming a
father and she's more in love with him than ever,' an insider told Page
Six last week.

'They're still adjusting to life as parents of a newborn and feel that
every day is a learning experience,' the source shared.

'When Justin asked Hailey what she wanted for Christmas this year, she
really couldn't think of anything because she has everything she could
ever want.'

The source also noted how the Biebers 'have discussed having more kids,
but for right now, they're happy with where things are at.'

She later swapped it out for a Happy New Year headband and showed it
off in a close-up selfie of just the top of her face.

The model also shared a photo of her expensive version of an In-N-Out
burger garnished with caviar.

Not long earlier, Hailey had issued an eyebrow-raising response to
trolls speculating, yet again, whether or not she's split from her
husband.

On Monday, prior to her New Year's Eve festivities, the Rhode founder
reposted a December 7th video by TikTok user @eyegotthyme, in which he
stated: 'You're not well and it's okay.'

Hailey — who boasts 75.2M social media followers — captioned her
Instagram Story: 'Me to all of you on the internet.'

@eyegotthyme aka self-mastery coach Bernard Joseph Velasquez later
must be somebody dope for you to be yelling at me in all caps haha hiii
Hailey babe!'

Bieber appeared to be specifically clapping back at TikToker Sloan
Hooks, who deduced the married couple of six years were allegedly
feuding by posting opposing songs via Instastory and claimed they were
spending the holidays apart.
