What's the story

West Bengal, located in eastern India, holds a rich culinary heritage,
with sweets being a particular highlight.

The bustling streets of Kolkata are a paradise for food lovers, with
vendors offering a wide array of traditional Bengali sweets.

From the syrupy delight of rosogolla to the creamy indulgence of mishti
doi, each treat is a testament to cultural traditions and craftsmanship
passed down through generations.

Rosogolla

Dive into the world of Rosogollas

The king of Bengali sweets, rosogolla needs no introduction.

These heavenly chhena (Indian cottage cheese) balls cooked in light
syrup are a must-try for anyone visiting West Bengal.

And at just ₹10 a piece (or even less), they're a treat that everyone
can afford.

Stalls throughout Kolkata also serve delicious variations like nolen
gur (date palm jaggery) flavored rosogollas during the winter months.

Mishti doi

Savor the richness of Mishti Doi

Mishti doi is a delight on the palate with its creamy texture and
caramelized sugar notes.

This fermented sweet yogurt is traditionally served in earthen pots,
lending it an earthy flavor.

You can find it at almost any sweet shop lining the streets of West
Bengal, with a small pot priced around ₹30.

It's not just a dessert, but an experience that embodies Bengali warmth
and culinary passion.

Sandesh

Indulge in sandesh varieties

Sandesh is a versatile sweet made from chhena and sugar or jaggery,
with endless variations in flavors and shapes.

From simple, unadorned ones to exotic fruit-flavored creations like
mango or strawberry, each sandesh offers a unique taste experience.

Prices range widely based on ingredients, but generally start from
₹20/piece.

Discovering different sandesh varieties gives one a glimpse into the
artistry and creativity that define Bengali sweet-making.

Patishapta

Discover the delightful Patishapta

Patishapta is essentially crepes stuffed with a sweet filling made from
a coconut or khoya (reduced milk) and jaggery mixture.

This treat is particularly beloved during Poush Parbon (the harvest
festival).

Priced at a modest ₹15/roll upwards, patishapta provides a harmonious
medley of textures and flavors that pay tribute to Bengal's
agricultural traditions and the season's bounty.

Chomchom

Explore street-side chomchom

Chomchom or cham cham is the one that transports you to flavor town
with its dense, milky texture and luscious coating of mawa (milk
solids) or coconut flakes.

Hailing from Tangail, Bangladesh, it has become an adopted child of
West Bengal's sweet family.

You can get it for around ₹25/piece. Fun fact: The different colors
indicate different flavors!

For instance, you might find saffron or rose water infused ones.
