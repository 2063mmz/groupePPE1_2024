Morgan Wallen and Kristin Cavallari (PC: Instagram)

Kristin Cavallari recalled her “sweet” date with Morgan Wallen. On
December 30, during her appearance on the Dumb Blonde podcast hosted by
Bunnie XO, wife of country singer Jelly Roll, the TV personality
addressed her rumored romance with the country music star.

The Hills alum confirmed that she “definitely hung out” with Wallen and
called him a good guy with a big heart. “The first date that we went
on, he was a true gentleman. He’s like, ‘I’ll pick you up; I’ll pick
the place,’” she recalled.

Cavallari recalled him meeting her three kids—sons Camden and Jaxon and
daughter Saylor—who were “so excited” upon the introduction. "(Wallen)
got us a private room with his bodyguard. He dropped me off. He kissed
me in the rain. And it was the sweetest thing. We hung out thereafter,"
she added.

Although their brief romance was "sweet,” it had its highs and lows.
She revealed that Wallen was the first man in her life who was not
completely “enamored” with her. "It really threw me," she added.

The couple were rumored to be dating in 2023, and during her appearance
on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in September, she put the
rumors to rest. He claimed that she was not dating Wallen at the time.
However, when host Andy Cohen asked if she went on a date with him,
Cavallari coyly responded, “I don’t know, I don’t know,” then pretended
to zip her lips shut.

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cavallari admitted that she
was “done dating in Nashville” and took the “guarantee” that she
wouldn’t settle down with the country music star. "I would consider
myself to be a monk at this point. You can throw anything at me, and
I'm like, 'OK,'" she added.

Cavallari has also been romantically linked to country singer Chase
Rice, comedian Jeff Dye, and Bachelor Nation alum Tyler Cameron since
her 2020 split from ex-husband Jay Cutler. The exes continue to
co-parent their three kids. "I've realized, what's going to drive
someone the craziest? Not giving them a reaction," she said at the
time.
