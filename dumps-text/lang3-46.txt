Why Louisiana is in a ‘sweet spot’ for attracting tech giants

State officials are making a concerted effort to position Louisiana as
a leader in the realm of AI—and that effort appears to be paying off.

Early this month, it was announced that Meta, the parent company of
Facebook and Instagram, is planning to build a $10 billion AI data
center in Richland Parish. Just days later, it was revealed that Hut 8,
a bitcoin miner headquartered in Miami, is planning to build a
similarly massive AI data center in West Feliciana Parish. And
officials have hinted that more announcements are on the horizon.

But what is it exactly that’s making Louisiana so attractive to these
out-of-state tech giants?

Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois tells Daily
Report that there are three key factors to consider:
* Land availability: Large-scale projects like data centers require
large swaths of land with reliable access to infrastructure.
Louisiana has ample land suitable for such projects.
* Energy capacity: Speed to market is something that’s highly valued
in the tech industry, and Louisiana’s energy providers are capable
of bringing additional power generation online rapidly.
* Workforce readiness: While Louisiana’s workers may not yet be
trained in emerging fields like AI, LED’s partnership with the
Louisiana Community and Technical College System enables the rapid
development of tailored training programs to equip them with the
skills they need to succeed in such industries.

“There are other states that have some of those things, but not all of
those things,” Bourgeois says. “They might have one or two of the
three, but Louisiana is in a sweet spot.”

When asked how LED is working to ensure Louisiana’s continued viability
as a tech hub, Bourgeois points to her organization’s proactive
approach to AI as a critical driver of future growth.

“AI is the future of technology as we know it, and everyone’s trying to
get ahead of this thing,” she says. “What folks in Louisiana should
both know and hopefully be very proud of is that we’re not sitting back
being reactionary to this.”

More specifically, Bourgeois envisions a near future in which Louisiana
serves as something of a “lab” for AI application. That’s because the
state’s existing expertise in fields like agriculture, defense and
water management provides a strong foundation for testing and
implementing innovative AI solutions that can address real-world
challenges.

“No one’s out ahead of AI yet because it’s all happening so quickly,”
Bourgeois says. “Louisiana is very much putting a ‘Why not us?’ stake
in the ground because we really are well positioned to be a leader in
that space.”
