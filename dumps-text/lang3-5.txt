Hello, what's the difference between those two adjectives and in which
cases do you use them?
For instance you say "a soft kiss" or "a smooth kiss" ?
And "a soft skin" or "a smooth skin"
Can something abstract be smooth or soft? Like music, ideas, etc?
Thank you :)

Hey Art GF;
You do not ask the easy questions do you?.. :D
Both can be used interchangeably for 'certain' things...
'Soft'
a soft kiss...(very gentle)..
soft colors...(not glaring)
a soft wind..(little breeze)
a soft voice..(not harsh)
soft on someone..(emotional)
soft pillow...(pressure)
'Smooth'
smooth person..(swave)
smooth table...(surface)
a smooth flight..(nothing happened/no bumps)
smooth chocolate..(consistency)
'Soft/Smooth'
soft/smooth fabric
soft/smooth skin
soft/smooth fur/hair
soft/smooth music
I know there are many..yadda,yadda..more..
hope it helps..

Generally, soft has to do with giving or indenting under pressure.
Smooth is a lack of roughness.
Te Gato, a "smooth person" is "suave" :)
And while soft and smooth can both be used in Te Gato's examples, they
have different meanings to me:
soft fabric: velvet, or fine cotton knit
smooth fabric: polished cotton, or other fabric without obvious weave
soft skin: you've just used lots of lotion
smooth skin: no pimples or hair
Soft hair: just washed and dried, nice to touch
smooth hair: no fly-aways, not curly
soft music: low volume
smooth music: run-together notes
These are abbreviated descriptions, obviously, and I'm sure others will
have clarifications... I hope!! :D

I'll let other people tackle the idea of smooth vs. soft.
But if you are talking about what kind of skin people have:
She has soft skin. She has smooth skin.
Be sure not to use an article. :)

Very true... but, "A soft leopard skin". :) In this case, we do use the
article.

To emphasize the differences: glass is smooth but not soft.
Fine aged whiskey is smooth but not soft.
The skin of a old woman after a bath is soft but not smooth.
The fleece of a sheep is soft but not smooth.

I know that neither of you would want to be caught giving the forum
anything but a smooth answer, so I will softly let you know:
You are both suave--whatever the language.
