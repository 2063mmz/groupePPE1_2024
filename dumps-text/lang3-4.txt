Lalisa "Lisa" Manobal, the globally renowned Thai K-pop star, is in top
spot for the 2024 Thailand's most powerful soft power poll, followed by
the baby pygmy hippo "Moo Deng" and the Butter Bear mascot, or "Nong
Mee Noei".

Sanit Siriwisitkul, chief of the North Bangkok Poll Centre, said the
poll on this year's soft power overview was conducted among 1,500
participants between Dec 24 and 28.

Of those, 25.4% voted Lisa the most influential soft power figure of
the year, followed by Moo Deng, the celebrity hippo at Khao Kieow Zoo,
with 15.2% of the votes and Butter Bear, the mascot of a bakery shop of
the same name, with 12.7% of the votes. The fourth and fifth spots went
to singer Danupa "Milli" Kanatheerakul (10.3%) and Muay Thai boxer
Buakhao Bunchamek (8.5%).

In June, Lisa released a music video Rockstar, filmed in the vibrant,
bustling nighttime food street of Yaowarat, Bangkok's iconic Chinatown.
It became this year's sensation while spotlighting Thailand's soft
power.

Mr Sanit also reported that 30.5% of participants saw Songkran as the
most influential festival for soft power promotion, followed by Loy
Krathong (18.3%), New Year's Day (14%), the Wai Khru Muay Thai ceremony
(9.5%) and long-tail boat races (7.7%).

fashion and clothes (20.3%), Thai food (15.2%), sports such as Muay
Thai (15.2%), and traditional Thai medicine and traditional Thai
massage (10.1%).

Earlier on Dec 24, Moo Deng was listed as the "Top Meme of the Year" on
X (Twitter), generating 7.7 million posts across the year.
