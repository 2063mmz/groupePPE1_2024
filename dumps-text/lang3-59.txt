GREAT FALLS — A beloved fixture of downtown Great Falls, Candy
Masterpiece, will close its doors on January 31, 2025, marking the end
of a 25-year journey that has brought joy and sweetness to the
community. For owner Angie Bruskotter, the decision to close the store
was a bittersweet one.

“I worked in the corporate world for quite some time. It was a good
career, but it had a lifeless attitude to it,” Angie shared. “Then it
came up that there was a little candy shop called Ranch Girl Wild West
Confectionery, and it was up for sale.”

That decision 25 years ago transformed Angie’s life and brought a
unique, whimsical business to downtown Great Falls. Candy Masterpiece
quickly became a community staple, drawing customers young and old with
its colorful displays and nostalgic treats.

A Difficult Decision
While Candy Masterpiece has been a labor of love, Angie explained that
it’s time for her to move on.

“I don’t like stress. I just don’t. It took me three years to make this
decision—to sell it, muscle up, and close it down,” she said. “I
thought very seriously about selling it, but I know businesses that
have been up for sale for eight years. For me, it just wasn’t worth it
anymore.”

Angie is looking forward to some well-earned downtime. “I’m going to
take two months off and veg out, remember who I am, do some art, work
in my yard, and do things I’ve been neglecting for a few years,” she
said. “Then I’m going to go back to school and become a massage
therapist. That’s the day you perish—when you stop learning.”

A Quarter Century of Sweet Memories
Over the years, Candy Masterpiece has created countless cherished
memories for its customers. Angie recalls many special moments,
including one that came full circle.

“There was a little girl in a red wagon with a little red hat named
Madeleine. She found the shop and was so excited,” Angie said. “A few
years ago, she came in as an adult with her kids. Those are some of my
favorite experiences—seeing people who are still coming back after 20
years.”

Despite the sadness of saying goodbye, Angie remains optimistic about
the future. “It’s been a blast. I’m going to miss all of the people,
but when it’s time for a change, it’s time.”

Shortly after news of the closure was announced, many people asked if
Bruskotter would consider selling the business to a new owner.

Candy Masterpiece posted the following message on Facebook to address
the issue:

We want to make a post about everyone asking about if Candy
Masterpiece is for sale. We want to make it very clear that Angie is
not interested in selling the business and to please stop asking. We
understand many of you want us to continue and we love that you
enjoy us so much, but this is Angie's choice and we kindly ask you
respect her decision and to stop asking. Thank you all for your kind
words and we hope you all can understand and see this from
ours/Angie's point of view. Thank you.

A Fond Farewell
As Candy Masterpiece prepares to close, customers are invited to stop
by, reminisce, and stock up on their favorite treats one last time.

“Did you have fun in the candy shop?” Angie asked a young customer, her
signature warmth on full display. “Should be big smiles with candy
now!”

Candy Masterpiece may be closing, but its legacy of joy and community
connection will remain a sweet memory for Great Falls. Until they
close, you can still visit Candy Masterpiece at 120 Central Avenue.
