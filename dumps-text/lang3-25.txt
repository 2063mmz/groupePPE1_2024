Ancient and medieval compatibilism

Compatibilism, as the name suggests, is the view that the existence of
free will and moral responsibility is compatible with the truth of
determinism. In most cases, compatibilists (also called “soft”
determinists) attempt to achieve this reconciliation by subtly revising
or weakening the commonsense notion of free will.

Compatibilism has an ancient history, and many philosophers have
endorsed it in one form or another. In Book III of the Nichomachean
Ethics, Aristotle (384–322 bce) wrote that humans are responsible for
the actions they freely choose to do—i.e., for their voluntary actions.
While acknowledging that “our dispositions are not voluntary in the
same sense that our actions are,” Aristotle believed that humans have
free will because they are free to choose their actions within the
confines of their natures. In other words, humans are free to choose
between the (limited) alternatives presented to them by their
dispositions. Moreover, humans also have the special ability to mold
their dispositions and to develop their moral characters. Thus, humans
have freedom in two senses: they can choose between the alternatives
that result from their dispositions, and they can change or develop the
dispositions that present them with these alternatives. One might
object that the capacity for self-examination and reflection
presupposed by this kind of freedom implies the existence of something
in humans that is outside the causal order. If this is so, then
Aristotle’s compatibilism is really a disguised form of libertarianism.

For medieval Scholastic philosophers, free will was a theological
problem. If God is the prime mover—the first cause of all things and
events in the universe, including human actions—and if the universe is
deterministic, then it seems to follow that humans never act freely.
How can humans do other than what God has caused them to do? How then
can they be morally responsible for their actions? An analogous problem
obtains regarding God’s omniscience: if God, being omniscient, has
foreknowledge of every choice that humans make, how can humans choose
other than what God knows they will choose?

In the late 4th and early 5th centuries, St. Augustine played a key
role in combining Greek philosophy with Christianity; his attempts to
reconcile human freedom with Christian notions such as divine
foreknowledge are still cited by theologians. According to Augustine,
God—a perfect, omnipotent, and omniscient being—exists outside the
realm of time. Temporal directionality does not exist for God, as it
does for humans. Hence, it makes no sense to attribute foreknowledge of
human choices to God.

Nearly a millennium later, St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) grappled with
the same problems. Like Augustine, he lived during a major turning
point in Western intellectual history, when the relationship between
philosophy and religion was being freshly examined and recast. In his
Summa theologiae (1265/66–73), Aquinas wrote that if humans do not have
free will, all “counsels, exhortations, commands, prohibitions,
rewards, and punishments would be in vain”; such a conclusion is simply
inconceivable. In response to the apparent conflict between freedom and
God’s role as the prime mover of human wills, Aquinas claimed that God
is in fact the source of human freedom. This is because God moves
humans “in accordance with our voluntary natures.”

Just as by moving natural causes God does not prevent their acts
being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive
their actions of being voluntary.

Because humans are created by God, their wills are naturally in harmony
with his. Thus, God’s role as prime mover need not get in the way of
free agency.

Modern compatibilism

Following the rediscovery of Classical learning during the Renaissance,
philosophers sympathetic to compatibilism shifted their focus from the
divine back to the individual. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes
(1588–1679) argued that the only condition necessary for free will and
moral responsibility is that there be a connection between one’s
choices and one’s actions. In his Leviathan (1651), he asserted that
desire, or inclination to do.” If people are able to do the things they
choose, then they are free.

The Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume (1711–76), another
staunch compatibilist, maintained that the apparent incompatibility
between determinism and free will rests on a confusion about the nature
of causation. Causation is a phenomenon that humans project onto the
world, he believed. To say that one thing (A) is the cause of another
thing (B) is nothing more than to say that things like A have been
constantly conjoined with things like B in experience and that an
observation of a thing like A inevitably brings to mind the idea or
expectation of a thing like B. There is nothing in nature itself that
corresponds to the “necessary connection” thought to exist between two
things that are causally related. Since there is just this kind of
regularity between human choices on the one hand and human actions on
the other, it follows that human actions are caused by human choices,
and this is all that is needed for free will. As Hume claimed in his
Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), “By liberty we can only
mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations
of the will.”

The British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–73) was the major
champion of compatibilism in the 19th century. He proposed that a
person is free when “his habits or his temptations are not his masters,
but he theirs.” Unfree people, in contrast, are those who obey their
desires even when they have good reasons not to. Mill’s position is
situated at an interesting turning point in compatibilist thinking. It
echoes Kant in its reliance on reason as the vehicle of freedom, but it
also anticipates contemporary compatibilism in its notion that a free
person is one whose internal desires are not at odds with reason.

In his Ethical Studies (1876), Mill’s countryman F.H. Bradley
(1846–1924) argued that neither compatibilism nor libertarianism comes
close to justifying what he called the “vulgar notion” of moral
responsibility. Determinism does not allow for free will because it
implies that humans are never the ultimate originators of their
actions. Indeterminism does no better, for it can imply only that human
decisions are completely random. Yet it is intuitively obvious,
according to Bradley, that humans have free will, and no philosophical
argument in the world will convince anyone otherwise. He thus advocated
a return to common sense. Given that the philosophical theory of
determinism necessarily conflicts with people’s deep-rooted moral
intuitions, it is better to abandon the former rather than the latter.

Contemporary compatibilism


Notwithstanding Bradley’s argument, compatibilism remained popular
among 20th-century thinkers. The Cambridge philosopher G.E. Moore
(1873–1958) attempted to reconcile determinism and free will through a
conditional analysis of freedom. To say that one has acted freely,
according to Moore, is simply to say that “I should” have acted
otherwise “if I had chosen” to do so, or “if I had performed a certain
act of will, I should have done something which I did not do.” The fact
that one may not have been in a position to choose otherwise does not
undermine one’s free agency. But what does it mean to say that one
could have done otherwise? In “Freedom and Necessity” (1946), A.J. Ayer
(1910–89) maintained that “to say that I could have acted otherwise is
to say that I should have acted otherwise if I had so chosen.” The
ability to do otherwise means only that if the past had been different,
one might have chosen differently. This is obviously a very weak notion
of freedom, for it implies that a choice or action can be free even
though it is completely determined by the past. It is an open question
whether Ayer’s account provides a satisfactory explanation of the
intuitive notion of free will. Supporters maintain that this is the
only type of freedom worth wanting, while detractors believe it does
not come close to providing the kind of free agency that humans desire,
in part because it does not imply that humans are morally responsible
for their “free” actions.

Other contemporary compatibilists have attacked the hard determinist’s
argument at a different juncture. In an influential paper, “Alternate
Possibilities and Moral Responsibility” (1969), the American
philosopher Harry Frankfurt questioned whether the ability to do
otherwise is truly necessary for freedom. Suppose that John is on his
way to a voting booth and is undecided about whether to vote for
candidate A or candidate B. Unbeknownst to him, an evil neuroscientist
has implanted in John’s brain a device that will, if required, fire a
signal that forces John to vote for candidate B. But John decides to
vote for candidate B on his own, so the device turns out to be
unnecessary. The device does not fire, so John acts freely. But John
could not have acted otherwise: if he had shown the slightest
inclination toward candidate A, the neuroscientist’s device would have
made him change his mind. This “Frankfurt-style” counterexample has
proved to be quite powerful in contemporary debates about free will. It
demonstrates that being able to do otherwise is not necessary for free
agency.

If the ability to do otherwise is not necessary, what is? Like Hobbes
and Hume, Frankfurt locates freedom solely within the self. In “Freedom
of the Will and the Concept of a Person” (1971), he proposed that
having free will is a matter of identifying with one’s desires in a
certain sense. Suppose that Jack is a drug addict who wants to reform.
He has a first-order desire for a certain drug, but he also has a
second-order desire not to desire the drug. Although Jack does not want
his first-order desire to be effective, he acts on it all the same.
Because of this inner conflict, Jack is not a free agent. Now consider
Jack’s friend Jill, who is also a drug addict. Unlike Jack, Jill has no
desire to reform. She has a first-order desire for a certain drug and a
second-order desire that her first-order desire be effective. She feels
no ambivalence at all about her drug addiction; not only does she want
the drug, but she also wants to want the drug. Jill identifies with her
first-order desire in a way that Jack does not, and therein lies her
freedom.

In “Freedom and Resentment” (1962), the British philosopher P.F.
Strawson (1919–2006) introduced an influential version of compatibilism
grounded in human psychology. Strawson observed that people display
emotions such as resentment, anger, gratitude, and so on in response to
the actions of others. He argued that holding agents morally
responsible for their actions is nothing more than having such
feelings, or “reactive attitudes,” toward them. The question of whether
the agents act freely matters only insofar as it affects the feelings
toward them that others may have; apart from this, freedom is beside
the point. Moreover, because people cannot help but feel reactive
attitudes, no matter how much they may try not to, they are justified
in having them, whatever the truth or falsity of determinism. (This is
not to say that the specific reactive attitude a person may have on a
given occasion—of blind rage as opposed to mere annoyance, for
example—is always justified.)

Yet it is far from clear that people are always justified in having
reactive attitudes. Pertinent information can drastically change one’s
feelings toward an agent. For example, one might become less angry with
a driver who ran over a cat if one discovers that the driver was
rushing to the hospital with a desperately ill child. One may even lose
the anger altogether. Given the enormous influence that everyday
factual information has over what reactive attitudes people have and
whether they even have them, it seems unwise to treat them as accurate
barometers of moral responsibility.

Conclusion

Although the central issues involved in the problem of free will and
moral responsibility have remained the same since ancient times, the
emphasis of the debate has changed greatly. Contemporary compatibilists
in the vein of Frankfurt and Strawson tend to argue that moral
responsibility has little if anything to do with determinism, since it
arises from people’s desires and attitudes rather than from the causal
origins of their actions. Humans may not be free to as great an extent
as the intuitive notion of free will suggests, but there is no other
freedom to be had. Addressing the problem of free will and moral
responsibility requires establishing guidelines for holding people
accountable, not lunging after some impossible notion of free will.

Contemporary libertarians in the vein of Chisholm, on the other hand,
continue to maintain that moral responsibility requires a certain kind
of robust free will that compatibilism does not allow for. Their prime
concern is to untangle the metaphysical issues underlying the
intelligibility objection and to make room for free will in an
indeterministic world.

How much of human behaviour is determined by past events, and how much
does this matter—if it does matter—for free will and moral
responsibility? In the end, the important question may be not whether
the universe is deterministic or indeterministic but whether one is
willing to accept a definition of free will that is much weaker than
intuition demands.
