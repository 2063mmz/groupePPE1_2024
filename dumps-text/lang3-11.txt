I can scroll through TikTok for hours at a time. It’s not an amazing
habit, I’ll admit, but it’s not all bad — because creators are
constantly putting me onto smart kitchen hacks. One game-changing
product that the platform introduced me to is the butter bell — a
vessel you can set out on your kitchen countertop, giving you access to
spreadable butter all the time. Having soft butter readily available to
place my favorite crisp sourdough toast is a literal dream for me, so
naturally, the gadget earned a spot on my wish list.

After searching on Amazon for the perfect one, I discovered that can
realize my dream for just $20. Not only is the Genuine Fred Forage
Butter Storage super affordable, but it’s also so cute! Shaped like a
little mushroom — which is right on trend — this gem looks like it’s
straight out of a fairytale. It’s sweet and whimsical and makes butter
soft, which is surely why thousands of Amazon shoppers bought it in the
last month alone. Keep reading to find out why it’s going straight into
my virtual cart, too.

What Is the Genuine Fred Forage Butter Storage?

Genuine Fred’s Forage Butter Storage is such an adorable way to
effortlessly soften butter and add some style to your countertop in the
process. At a little over four inches tall, it looks like a brown
mushroom with polka dots on top, but when you pick up the mushroom cap,
it’s hollow, ready to be filled with a full stick of butter. After
that, your butter is ready to be spread onto your favorite bread,
muffins, and more!

Unlike a butter dish that you keep in your fridge, this gadget allows
butter to stay unrefrigerated for up to a month (if you don’t run out,
that is)! To get it set up, you’ll squish your butter into the cylinder
that’s attached to the mushroom cap. Then, you’ll slot that piece into
the cylindrical base, which you’ll have already filled with cold salted
water. That’s it! Gone are the days when you had to remove a stick from
your fridge well ahead of time to make it spreadable.
