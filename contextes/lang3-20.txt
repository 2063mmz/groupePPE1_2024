which is the softness of the mean-field potential developed by us
earlier. We find that this softness is sensitive to small changes in
some universal behaviours like the softness is linearly proportional
the softness parameter and show that indeed the dynamics when scaled
collapse when plotted against softness. The dynamics of fragile
liquids show a strong softness dependence whereas that of strong
liquids show a much weaker softness dependence. We also connect the
present study with the earlier studies of softness involving machine
