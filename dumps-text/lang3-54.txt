“The soul of our home (I’m the heart) we love you so much,” Teigen
wrote, captioning a photo of Legend sitting on a swing tethered to a
ceiling decorated with blue balloons. “Happy 46th birthday. You spent
it taking the kids to the bubble experience in London at 8am, and now
we are heading to the Devil Wears Prada musical because you’re up for
any kind of date night you can get, ever.”

“I love you so much, we love you so much,” added the model. “Happy
birthday.”

Teigen and the “Love Me Now” singer have been married since 2013 and
share four kids — Luna, Miles, Esti and Wren. Three days prior to
Legend’s birthday, Teigen shared photos on Instagram of her family
sitting around their Christmas tree, the kids wearing matching festive
pajamas.

“Christmas morning in London! Merry Christmas, guys,” she wrote at the
time. “We love you so much.”

In August, Legend dropped an album of children’s lullabies titled My
Favorite Dream, featuring guest vocals from his wife and their two
oldest children on lead single “L-O-V-E.” The Voice coach and his
eldest daughter recently stopped by Billboard to chat about the LP in a
sweet interview conducted by Luna.

“I think it’s the most pure love you can have, the love you have for
your family,” Legend said during the father-daughter conversation.
“It’s so pure. When me and Mommy look at you, and look at your brothers
and sister, we see ourselves and we want to pour all this knowledge and
these lessons we’ve learned in life into you and help you become the
best adults you can be.”
