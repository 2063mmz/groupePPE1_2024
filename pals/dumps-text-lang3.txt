Generally
,
soft
has
to
do
with
giving
or
indenting
under
pressure
.
Smooth
is
a
lack
of
roughness

General
Qassem
Soleimani
:
master
of
soft

in
Iran
'
s
strategic

MADRID
–
In
the
global
competition
for
influence
,
soft
power
has
become
a
key
indicator
of
national
strength
.
In
contrast
to
direct
confrontations
involving
hard
power
,
an
increasing
number
of
countries
are
opting
for
less
costly
yet
equally
effective
strategies
,
using
resources
that
attract
and
persuade
rather
than
impose
.
Soft
power
encompasses
the
abilities
that
allow
states
to
project
their
influence
through
the
promotion
of
cultural
and
political
values
,
as
well
as
through
the
development
of
scientific
,
technological
,
and
,
in
some
cases
,
even
military
resources
.
This
more
subtle
and
strategic
approach
turns
these
tools
into
an
integrated
set
that
drives
their
objectives
on
the
international
stage
.
Following
the
triumph
of
the
Islamic
Revolution
,
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
has
consolidated
significant
political
influence
in
West
Asia
.
In
addition
to
its
vast
natural
resources
and
strategic
location
,
the
region
has
been
marked
by
the
intervention
of
external
actors
in
the
internal
affairs
of
its
countries
,
intensifying
tensions
and
contributing
to
the
emergence
of
various
crises
.
This
context
has
favored
Iran
'
s
rise
as
a
key
player
in
the
reshaping
of
the
regional
balance
of
power
.
The
actions
of
the
Quds
Force
of
the
Islamic
Revolution
Guard
Corps
(
IRGC
)
,
led
by
General
Qassem
Soleimani
,
played
a
central
role
in
the
power
dynamics
of
West
Asia
,
particularly
in
Iraq
and
Syria
.
Between
2003
and
2011
,
the
late
Soleimani
succeeded
in
significantly
weakening
U
.
S
.
influence
in
Iraq
while
also
focusing
on
combating
terrorism
in
the
region
.
For
more
than
two
decades
,
General
Soleimani
'
s
methods
and
principles
were
distinguished
by
his
ability
to
manage
regional
and
international
transformations
,
thereby
consolidating
the
position
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
both
regionally
and
globally
.
In
this
context
,
General
Soleimani
'
s
operations
were
key
to
the
strategic
defeats
of
the
United
States
in
West
Asia
,
which
not
only
strengthened
Iran
'
s
power
but
also
eroded
U
.
S
.
influence
in
the
region
,
particularly
among
Arab
countries
.
Thus
,
General
Soleimani
has
been
recognized
as
the
"
architect
of
the
strategic
defeats
of
the
United
States
in
West
Asia
.
"
This
article
focuses
on
two
central
questions
:
What
role
did
General
Soleimani
play
in
strengthening
Iran
'
s
soft
power
in
the
West
Asia
region
?
And
,
under
what
strategic
principles
was
his
deployment
of
power
developed
?
The
concept
of
soft
power
was
introduced
by
scholar
Joseph
Nye
in
1990
in
an
article
published
in
The
Atlantic
.
In
his
analysis
,
Nye
emphasized
the
importance
of
understanding
the
different
ways
in
which
power
can
be
exercised
,
distinguishing
between
direct
power
,
associated
with
an
authoritarian
style
,
and
indirect
power
,
focused
on
persuasion
.
In
the
first
case
,
power
is
exercised
through
tools
such
as
rewards
,
threats
,
or
coercion
.
In
the
second
,
soft
power
manifests
itself
through
factors
such
as
the
attraction
of
ideas
and
beliefs
,
the
ability
to
set
a
political
agenda
,
and
the
influence
of
culture
,
ideology
,
and
institutions
that
shape
the
preferences
of
other
actors
.
Nye
defines
soft
power
as
the
ability
to
attract
,
which
often
leads
to
the
fulfillment
of
one
'
s
own
interests
.
Unlike
hard
power
,
which
relies
on
force
,
threats
,
or
rewards
,
soft
power
enables
a
country
to
achieve
its
objectives
through
indirect
and
persuasive
means
.
According
to
Nye
'
s
theory
,
the
essence
of
soft
power
lies
in
the
ability
to
shape
the
preferences
of
others
,
a
process
that
is
achieved
in
an
intangible
manner
through
the
promotion
of
cultural
appeal
,
values
,
and
political
structures
.
However
,
soft
power
is
distinct
from
influence
in
its
foundation
:
while
influence
may
rely
on
hard
power
and
coercion
,
soft
power
is
based
on
the
ability
to
attract
and
persuade
,
always
contingent
upon
consent
.
To
analyze
the
impact
of
Iran
'
s
soft
power
in
West
Asia
,
it
is
essential
to
understand
the
sources
of
this
type
of
power
.
With
this
understanding
of
soft
power
resources
in
the
countries
of
the
region
,
it
becomes
possible
to
identify
the
role
of
General
Soleimani
in
strengthening
the
influence
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
in
the
region
.
Beliefs
and
values
,
which
arise
from
social
norms
and
specific
patterns
of
historical
,
social
,
climatic
,
political
,
economic
,
and
cultural
contexts
,
form
the
foundation
of
soft
power
.
This
type
of
power
is
based
on
the
ability
to
influence
the
preferences
and
values
of
others
,
utilizing
intangible
elements
such
as
personal
appeal
,
cultural
values
,
political
institutions
,
and
policies
perceived
as
legitimate
and
ethical
.
In
this
context
,
General
Qassem
Soleimani
was
able
to
leverage
these
sources
of
power
to
promote
the
Islamic
discourse
,
thereby
strengthening
Iran
'
s
position
in
West
Asia
.
His
ability
to
establish
trust
-
based
relationships
was
a
crucial
factor
in
this
process
.
Trust
,
as
a
fundamental
pillar
of
social
capital
,
plays
a
crucial
role
in
soft
power
.
Social
trust
is
defined
as
the
expectations
and
commitments
socially
acquired
and
validated
,
which
implies
a
relationship
of
trust
both
between
individuals
and
towards
the
organizations
and
institutions
that
influence
social
life
.
In
this
regard
,
the
trust
that
General
Soleimani
cultivated
in
the
region
,
both
among
his
own
forces
and
with
regional
forces
,
enabled
the
countries
of
West
Asia
to
establish
a
special
relationship
with
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
.
This
created
a
favorable
environment
for
cooperation
and
facilitated
the
overcoming
of
common
challenges
.
Diplomacy
,
as
a
key
dimension
of
soft
power
,
has
been
an
essential
component
of
the
United
States
'
international
strategies
since
World
War
II
,
particularly
in
West
Asia
.
In
this
context
,
it
has
also
been
used
in
what
some
analysts
refer
to
as
the
"
ideological
war
.
"
An
example
of
this
is
the
use
of
sectarian
discourse
aimed
at
generating
divisions
between
Shiites
and
Sunnis
in
the
region
,
as
part
of
a
strategy
to
influence
the
political
and
social
dynamics
.
The
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
'
s
response
to
the
attempt
to
create
sectarian
divisions
was
to
deploy
an
Islamic
and
ummatic
discourse
,
based
on
the
unity
of
the
Muslim
community
beyond
sectarian
boundaries
.
In
this
regard
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
General
Soleimani
'
s
success
in
the
region
was
not
solely
due
to
the
use
of
hard
power
resources
.
His
success
was
the
result
of
a
comprehensive
approach
that
combined
soft
power
to
persuade
the
countries
of
the
region
to
unite
in
the
fight
against
terrorism
and
imperialism
.
This
approach
included
the
use
of
cultural
,
political
,
communication
,
and
management
tools
,
which
enabled
him
to
consolidate
alliances
and
strengthen
Iran
'
s
influence
in
West
Asia
.
From
the
perspective
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
,
one
of
the
key
factors
driving
the
increase
in
its
soft
power
in
the
region
is
the
nature
of
its
objectives
.
The
central
purpose
of
Iran
’
s
presence
in
West
Asia
,
according
to
the
political
principles
established
after
the
Islamic
Revolution
,
has
been
the
liberation
of
peoples
from
external
aggressors
and
repressive
governments
.
Iran
positions
itself
as
a
defender
of
sovereignty
and
self
-
determination
for
peoples
,
supporting
regional
governments
in
the
face
of
aggression
,
foreign
occupation
,
and
terrorist
and
extremist
threats
.
This
approach
has
strengthened
the
trust
relationship
with
governments
in
the
region
,
which
view
Iran
as
a
strategic
ally
in
the
defense
of
their
independence
and
security
.
After
the
triumph
of
the
Islamic
Revolution
in
1979
and
the
creation
of
the
Islamic
Republic
,
a
series
of
discourses
based
on
the
Islamist
vision
expressed
by
the
revolutionary
leader
,
Imam
Khomeini
,
began
to
mobilize
.
These
discourses
have
deeply
influenced
Iran
’
s
foreign
policy
and
the
construction
of
its
identity
up
to
the
present
day
.
In
this
context
,
Islamism
can
be
defined
as
the
discourse
that
seeks
to
make
Islam
the
central
point
in
the
political
and
social
structures
of
Muslim
communities
.
It
is
crucial
to
differentiate
between
Islamism
and
Islamization
.
While
Islamism
makes
Islam
an
explicit
political
reference
,
Islamization
refers
to
the
visibility
of
Islam
in
cultural
and
religious
spaces
without
necessarily
integrating
it
as
a
fundamental
language
or
tool
in
international
relations
,
public
policies
,
or
decision
-
making
.
This
Iranian
Islamism
has
led
the
country
to
pursue
two
fundamental
objectives
,
considered
essential
for
the
consolidation
of
its
soft
power
and
influence
in
the
region
:
1
.
The
unity
of
Islam
under
the
"
ummatic
mandate
"
:
This
objective
involves
adhering
to
the
vision
of
Imam
Khomeini
,
the
founder
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
,
which
advocates
for
rapprochement
between
Sunni
and
Shia
Muslims
.
The
idea
is
to
build
a
common
language
among
Muslims
,
promoting
understanding
and
dialogue
between
the
different
branches
of
Islam
,
all
within
the
parameters
set
by
this
unity
.
In
technical
terms
,
this
concept
is
known
as
the
"
post
-
madhab
vision
"
(
where
madhab
means
legal
school
in
Arabic
)
,
which
seeks
interaction
based
on
the
shared
principles
of
Islam
,
overcoming
sectarian
divisions
.
2
.
The
construction
of
a
just
society
:
This
second
objective
responds
to
a
fundamental
ethical
-
political
aspiration
,
whose
horizon
is
unattainable
but
always
present
.
According
to
the
Iranian
conception
,
the
struggle
for
justice
is
a
constant
duty
that
must
lead
Muslims
to
confront
oppression
in
its
various
forms
,
whether
political
,
economic
,
or
social
.
It
can
be
stated
,
therefore
,
that
the
central
axis
around
which
all
Iranian
discourse
is
articulated
is
the
“
Islamic
,
revolutionary
,
and
anti
-
Western
identity
.
”
From
this
fundamental
principle
,
the
foreign
and
defense
policy
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
is
understood
.
Through
this
approach
,
concepts
such
as
independence
,
resistance
,
Islamic
unity
,
and
responsibility
toward
the
ummah
are
intertwined
,
shaping
Iran
’
s
unique
Islamic
discourse
while
distinguishing
it
from
other
international
actors
.
A
distinctive
principle
of
Iranian
foreign
policy
is
what
is
termed
responsibility
toward
the
Muslim
world
,
which
views
Iran
’
s
actions
beyond
its
borders
as
an
"
ideological
duty
.
"
This
vision
also
encompasses
the
anti
-
Zionist
policy
and
support
for
Islamic
resistance
movements
in
the
region
,
forming
what
is
known
as
the
"
Axis
of
Resistance
.
"
This
principle
is
formalized
in
Article
152
of
the
Constitution
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
(
adopted
on
October
24
,
1979
)
,
which
states
:
"
The
foreign
policy
of
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
is
based
on
…
the
defense
of
the
rights
of
all
Muslims
,
non
-
alignment
with
respect
to
hegemonic
superpowers
,
and
the
maintenance
of
mutually
peaceful
relations
with
all
non
-
belligerent
states
.
"
Another
fundamental
principle
in
Iran
'
s
strategic
culture
is
its
anti
-
hegemonic
vocation
and
willingness
to
resist
.
Based
on
the
idea
that
Islam
must
prevail
and
not
be
dominated
by
others
,
Iran
believes
that
it
cannot
allow
foreign
powers
to
impose
their
will
on
its
foreign
policy
.
This
anti
-
imperialist
identity
is
deeply
rooted
in
Iran
'
s
history
,
which
has
been
marked
by
repeated
attempts
by
Western
powers
to
control
the
country
.
Iranian
leaders
consistently
call
for
countering
hegemony
and
resisting
imperialism
,
considering
it
an
essential
principle
of
their
foreign
behavior
.
In
this
context
,
Leader
of
the
Islamic
Revolution
Ayatollah
Seyyed
Ali
Khamenei
stated
in
a
speech
in
August
2007
,
"
We
will
never
tolerate
hegemonic
behaviors
.
.
.
and
countering
the
global
hegemonic
system
and
overcoming
the
equation
of
oppressors
-
oppressed
is
an
inseparable
indicator
of
our
diplomacy
.
"
This
statement
underscores
Iran
'
s
commitment
to
an
anti
-
hegemonic
stance
,
which
guides
its
international
strategy
.
From
the
early
days
of
the
Islamic
Republic
,
the
principles
of
counter
-
hegemony
were
materialized
in
the
policy
of
“
Neither
East
Nor
West
,
Only
the
Islamic
Republic
,
”
which
can
be
considered
Iran
'
s
version
of
non
-
alignment
.
At
that
time
,
Iranian
revolutionary
authorities
established
three
fundamental
political
goals
:
(
1
)
achieving
autonomy
in
the
formulation
of
foreign
policy
,
(
2
)
ending
Iran
'
s
dependence
on
a
single
ideological
bloc
,
and
(
3
)
improving
relations
with
all
states
,
except
Israel
and
the
apartheid
regime
of
South
Africa
.
Two
fundamental
principles
within
Iran
'
s
strategic
culture
are
self
-
sufficiency
and
independence
.
After
the
Islamic
Revolution
,
the
pursuit
of
indigenous
capabilities
,
technology
,
and
knowledge
—
particularly
with
regard
to
the
nuclear
fuel
cycle
—
became
a
source
of
national
pride
.
In
this
way
,
Iran
seeks
to
reduce
its
dependence
on
foreign
powers
.
Ayatollah
Khamenei
has
emphasized
the
causal
relationship
between
scientific
progress
,
self
-
sufficiency
,
and
independence
.
According
to
the
Leader
,
the
sanctions
imposed
by
the
United
States
and
Europe
are
not
only
ineffective
in
changing
Iran
'
s
foreign
policy
,
but
in
fact
,
they
are
constructive
,
as
they
force
the
country
to
become
more
self
-
sufficient
.
Finally
,
it
is
crucial
to
understand
how
the
Islamic
Republic
views
the
global
management
system
.
Iranian
authorities
consider
the
international
system
to
be
unjust
and
unequal
,
advocating
for
a
more
just
world
order
.
Since
the
Islamic
Revolution
,
Iran
has
pursued
a
revisionist
policy
centered
on
justice
and
the
creation
of
equitable
international
relations
,
urging
countries
they
deem
arrogant
to
act
more
justly
.
It
can
thus
be
said
that
the
figure
of
the
late
Qassem
Soleimani
,
from
the
perspective
of
the
Islamic
Republic
,
embodies
the
revolutionary
principles
established
after
the
triumph
of
1979
.
His
ability
to
use
soft
power
consolidated
him
as
one
of
the
most
relevant
figures
,
not
only
in
Iran
but
throughout
the
region
.
He
stood
out
for
his
capacity
to
influence
and
build
alliances
based
on
shared
values
and
common
objectives
,
which
strengthened
Iran
'
s
role
in
both
the
regional
and
international
arenas
.

My
Detailed
Review
:
As

you
can

help
but
think
that

.
And
then
you
see
angler
,
Kyoya

,
dominate
the

Toledo
Bend
with
it
and
you
know
this
is
something
special
.
That
unique
lip
design
causes
a
rocking
,
twisting
,
swimming
action
bass
can
'
t
resist
.
This
versatile
lure
can
be
used
as
a
trailer
for
bladed
jigs
,
spinnerbaits
,
umbrella

,
and
more
,
but
it

designed
for

,
with
beautiful

options
,

and

,
this

is
going
to
finesse
a
lot
of
bass

of

soft

bass
lures
out
of

in

The
Crush
City
Freeloader
was
found
to
work
exceptionally
well
for
mid
-
strolling
techniques
,
but
it
was
actually
designed
as
a
bladed
jig
trailer
where
it
works
just
as
well
.

Rapala
Why
it
’
s
Great
:
There
will
be
those
who
question
why
I
’
m
featuring
the
Freeloader
over
the
Mooch
Minnow
.
For
me
,
the
Freeloader
is
the
bait
I
got
to
spend
all
year
fishing
and
fall
in
love
with
.
It
’
s
just
a
great
,
subtle
,
versatile
,
finesse
bait
.
It
has
become
my
go
-
to
bladed
-
jig
trailer
.
My
Detailed
Review
:
I
got
to
speak
with
Dan
Quinn
,
who
was
very
involved
in
the
development
of
the
Crush
City
Freeloader
.
He
explained
,
“
We
designed
it
as
a
trailer
for
a
chatter
bait
or
spinner
bait
or
things
like
that
.
But
then
this
new
technique
of
just
rigging
it
on
a
on
a
jig
head
has
taken
the
world
by
storm
.
”
“
One
of
the
cool
features
about
this
bait
,
is
having
a
straight
tail
.
The
straight
tail
means
that
it
doesn
’
t
keel
the
bait
,
so
it
enhances
the
action
and
the
hunting
nature
of
the
bait
’
s
movement
.
If
it
had
a
more
traditional
tail
on
it
,
that
would
keel
it
(
keep
it
running
in
a
predictable
,
straight
path
)
.
”
“
I
can
tell
you
,
fish
have
a
really
hard
time
,
not
biting
it
,
”
said
Quinn
.
I
can
tell
you
,
I
’
ve
personally
confirmed
everything
Dan
said
.

Why
it
’
s
Great
:
Simple
and
effective
,
are
about
the
best
traits
you
can
ask
for
in
a
bass
bait
.
These
Thumper
Worms
are
obviously
based
on
an
old
,
proven
favorite
design
,
the
speed
worm
,
but
all
of
the
specific
detail
of
this
bait
have
been
well
sorted
.
I
can
tell
you
,
this
worm
will
fool
a
lot
of
fish
living
in
shallow
weed
flats
.
My
Detailed
Review
:
The
Thumper
Pro
Magnum
Speed
Worm
from
CPF
Lures
is
a
can
’
t
miss
.
They
’
re
super
easy
to
fish
and
big
bass
eat
them
everywhere
they
live
.
While
it
looks
like
a
fairly
simple
worm
,
CPF
Lures
put
a
ton
of
designing
,
engineering
and
testing
into
these
baits
until
they
were
absolutely
perfect
.
They
’
re
made
from
a
proprietary
blend
soft
plastic
with
incredible
durability
and
action
,
causing
the
tail
to
“
thump
”
both
subtly
and
dramatically
at
the
same
time
,
and
catch
bass
after
bass
without
tearing
.

/
Rapala
Why
it
’
s
Great
:
As
someone
who
has
used
a
lot
of
different
craw
models
over
the
years
,
this
one
really
ticks
all
the
boxes
for
me
.
And
because
I
know
it
’
s
hard
to
imagine
how
a
bait
actually
moves
in
the
water
,
I
recommend
you
take
a
look
at
the
short
attached
video
.
The
way
this
thing
looks
underwater
will
definitely
catch
fishermen
and
fish
.
My
Detailed
Review
:
The
Crush
City
Freeloader
and
Mooch
Minnow
have
stolen
all
the
bass
fishing
headlines
,
but
don
’
t
sleep
on
this
amazing
new
craw
bait
design
,
especially
when
you
’
re
not
scoping
fish
.
Yes
,
it
’
s
true
…
sometimes
anglers
catch
bass
they
’
re
not
looking
at
on
a
screen
.
Like
all
CrushCity
™
baits
,
the
Cleanup
Craw
™
comes
from
the
mind
of
incredibly
successful
bass
pro
,
Jacob
Wheeler
.
At
3
.
5
inches
long
,
the
Cleanup
Craw
™
is
the
ultimate
bass
snack
.
The
sort
of
meaty
,
scooped
,
claw
shape
provides
a
very
consistent
,
tight
-
kicking
action
.
And
the
unique
,
forward
-
facing
legs
along
the
sides
of
the
bait
,
provide
subtle
,
secondary
action
with
the
slightest
movement
.
Plus
,
the
back
ribs
allow
the
angler
to
skin
hook
the
point
in
those
ribs
,
but
after
a
fish
or
two
,
skin
hook
into
the
body
of
the
bait
to
maximize
usage
,
getting
a
couple
more
fish
out
of
every
bait
.

the
Hindu
Bhakti
saint
Vallabha

was
a
Telugu
Brahmin
who
propagated
Pushtimarg
,
which
emphasizes
on
the
unconditional
bhakti
and
seva
of
Krishna
.
According
to
legend
,
when
Krishna
himself
appeared
in
front
of
Vallabha
,
on
the
midnight
of
Shravana
Shukla
Ekadashi
,
the
philosopher
composed
the
Madhurashtakam
in
praise
of
the
deity
.

created
many
other
literary
pieces
including
the
Vyasa
Sutra
Bhashya
,
Jaimini
Sutra
Bhasya
,
Bhagavata
Subodhini
Tika
,
Pushti
Pravala
Maryada
,
and
Siddhanta
Rahasya
,
in

(
darshana
)
a
beatific
image
of
the
deity
and
offering
of
services
(
seva
)
.

to
this
philosophy

experience
the
deity
'
s
real
essence
(

instrumental
role

the
realisation

the
deity

It
’
s
not
an
amazing
habit
,
I
’
ll
admit
,
but
it
’
s
not
all
bad
—
because
creators
are
constantly
putting
me
onto
smart
kitchen
hacks
.
One
game
-
changing
product
that
the
platform
introduced
me
to
is
the
butter
bell
—
a
vessel
you
can
set
out
on
your
kitchen
countertop
,
giving
you
access
to
spreadable
butter
all
the
time
.
Having
soft
butter
readily
available
to
place
my
favorite
crisp
sourdough
toast
is
a
literal
dream
for
me
,
so
naturally
,
the
gadget
earned
a
spot
on

wish
list
.
After
searching
on
Amazon
for
the
perfect
one
,
I
discovered
that
can
realize
my
dream
for
just
$
20
.
Not
only
is
the
Genuine

super
affordable

but
it
’
s
also
so
cute
!
Shaped
like
a
little
mushroom
—
which
is
right
on
trend
—
this
gem
looks
like
it
’
s
straight
out
of
a
fairytale
.
It
’
s
sweet
and
whimsical
and
makes
butter
soft
,
which
is
surely
why
thousands
of
Amazon
shoppers
bought
it
in
the
last

alone
.

What
Is
the
Genuine
Fred
Forage
Butter
Storage
?
Genuine
Fred
’
s
Forage
Butter
Storage
is
such
an
adorable
way
to
effortlessly
soften
butter
and
add
some
style
to
your
countertop
in
the
process
.
At
a
little
over
four
inches
tall
,
it
looks
like
a
brown
mushroom
with
polka
dots
on
top
,
but
when
you
pick
up
the
mushroom
cap
,
it
’
s
hollow
,
ready
to
be
filled
with
a
full
stick
of
butter
.
After
that
,
your
butter
is
ready
to
be
spread
onto
your
favorite
bread
,
muffins
,
and
more
!

Unlike
a
butter
dish
that
you
keep
in
your
fridge
,
this
gadget
allows
butter
to
stay
unrefrigerated
for
up
to
a
month
(
if
you
don
’
t
run
out
,
that
is
)
!
To
get
it
set
up
,
you
’
ll
squish
your
butter
into
the
cylinder
that
’
s
attached
to
the
mushroom
cap
.
Then
,
you
’
ll
slot
that
piece
into
the
cylindrical
base
,
which
you
’
ll
have
already
filled
with
cold
salted
water
.
That
’
s
it
!
Gone
are
the
days
when
you
had
to
remove
a
stick
from
your
fridge
well
ahead
of
time
to
make
it
spreadable
.

Thesis
The
aesthetics
of
sugar
:
concepts
of
sweetness
in
the
nineteenth
century
Abstract
:
My
thesis
examines
the
concept
of
sweetness
as
an
aesthetic
category
in
nineteenth
-
century
British
culture
.
My
contention
is
that
a
link
exists
between
the
idea
of
sweetness
as
it
appears
in
literary
works
and
sugar
as
an
everyday
commodity
with
a
complex
history
attached
.
Sugar
had
changed
from
being
considered
as
a
luxury
in
1750
to
a
mass
-
market
staple
by
the
1850s
,
a
major
cultural
transition
which
altered
the
concept
of
sweetness
as
a
taste
.
In
the
thesis
I
map
the
consequences
of
thi
.

Soft
skills
are
timeless
assets
that
every
professional
needs
to
develop
and
grow
their
career
.
As
workplaces
continue
to
evolve
with
digital
transformation
,
AI
implementation
,
and
structured
hybrid
remote
work
models
,
as
well
as
increased
demand
for
certain
skill
sets
and
role
types
,
it
becomes
more
of
a
necessity
for
you
to
master
skills
that
will
ensure
long
-
term
career
success
and
stability
.
The
incredible
thing
about
soft
skills
is
that
they
'
re
not
only
transferable
across
industries
and
transcend
roles
,
but
they
are
also
high

income
skills
,
meaning
that
they
are
the
gateway
to
high

career
and
business
opportunities
.
You
could
easily
have
strong
technical
skills
and
the
know

how
to
perform
your
job
role
well
,
but
,
as
numerous
studies
and
the
experience
of
employers
hiring
Gen
Z
graduates
has
proven
,
without
soft
skills
your
technical
knowledge
will
be
worthless
and
bar
you
from
more
opportunities
.
What
'
s
worse
,
you
might
not
even
continue
in
your
current
job
at
all
,
making
it
difficult
for
you
to
make
any
progress
up
the
career
ladder
.

Resilience
Skills
The
next
important
soft
skill
is
resilience
.
Resilience
is
necessary
to
overcome
and
recover
from
setbacks
at
work
and
in
your
career
.
Over
the
course
of
your
career
journey
,
you
'
ll
likely
encounter
several
obstacles
in
many
different
forms
,
such
as
a
failed
business
pitch
,
job
rejections
,
a
working
relationship
that
'
s
not
working
out
so
well
between
you
and
your
employer
,
or
being
told
no
several
times
when
seeking
a
promotion
or
other
advanced
career
opportunity
.
Having
resilience
will
enable
you
to
maintain
focus
in
the
face
of
these
setbacks
,
and
it
'
ll
guide
you
towards
achieving
your
goals
in
spite
of
it
all
,
ultimately
leading
to
a
lifetime
of
career
success
.

Networking
Skills
You
'
ve
probably
heard
of
the
saying
that
goes
,
"
Your
network
is
your
net
worth
.
"
Networking
skills
opens
up
doors
that
you
probably
never
deemed
existed
.
You
'
ll
be
able
to
find
invaluable
mentorship
/
mentee
opportunities
so
you
can
contribute
meaningfully
to
someone
else
'
s
career
while
growing
your
own
,
and
you
'
ll
also
have
opportunities
for
strategic
business
partnerships
and
collaborations
.
But
to
network
effectively
,
you
need
two
essential
sets
of
skills
:
relationship
-
building
and
communication
skills
(
emotional
intelligence
is
part
of
this
)
,
and
the
ability
to
select
the
right
people
to
be
part
of
your
inner
circle
.
This
is
because
you
'
ll
end
up
wasting
your
time
using
your
relationship
-
building
skills
on
people
who
cannot
make
an
ounce
of
difference
to
your
career
,
but
are
simply
time
-
wasters
.
You
want
to
concentrate
on
finding
the
right
people
—
decision
-
makers
,
recruiters
,
key
contacts
,
inspirational
professionals
and
leading
voices
in
your
industry
—
and
spending
time
cultivating
connections
with
them
,
because
these
are
the
ones
who
you
'
ll
have
a
mutually
beneficial
relationship
with
.

A
Reddit
post
went
viral
after
a
user
shared
a
restaurant
bill
that
included
a
5
%
gratuity
charge
,
sparking
widespread
debate
.
The
anonymous
user
questioned
whether
this
“
gratuity
”
charge
had
been
around
for
a
while
.
The
bill
shows
that
the
customer
ordered
multiple
types
of
Chinese
food
,
pizza
,
and
soft
drinks
.
The
restaurant
,
named
Cafe
24
,
charged
state
and
central
GST
at
9
%
,
amounting
to
Rs
746
.
58
each
.

However
,
the
shocking
part
was
the
additional
5
%
gratuity
charge
on
the
entire
bill
,
which
amounted
to
Rs
395
.
The
total
bill
for
the
customer
came
to
Rs
9
,
788
.
Following
the
post
,
it
went
viral
,
garnering
over
2
,
000
likes
and
nearly
400
comments
.
“
No
,
ask
them
to
remove
it
.
Charging
5
%
on
the
bill
amount
and
calling
it
gratuity
is
crazy
;
it
should
be
classified
as
robbery
,
”
said
one
social
media
user
.
Another
added
,
“
It
’
s
basically
a
tip
that
they
’
ve
added
on
your
behalf
.
You
can
ask
them
to
remove
it
,
and
they
are
legally
required
to
do
so
.
If
they
do
not
remove
it
,
you
can
take
legal
action
.

four
quantities
of
Pepsi
costing
around

The
Drama
of
Hardness
and
Softness
in
Painting
By
Eli
Siegel
This
essay
was
written
in
1953
.
I
will
aggravate
my
voice
so
that
I
will
roar
you
as
gently
as
any
sucking
dove
;
I
will
roar
you
an
’
twere
any
nightingale
.
—
A
Midsummer
Night
’
s
Dream
Piero
della
Francesca
and
Jean
Baptiste
Camille
Corot
are
,
at
this
moment
,
both
of
art
:
their
work
is
true
to
art
.
The
immediate
effect
,
however
,
of
a
painting
by
the
fifteenth
-
century
Italian
is
different
from
that
of
the
nineteenth
-
century
Frenchman
.
One
could
be
critically
elaborate
about
the
verticals
,
the
restraint
,
the
severity
,
the
containment
of
,
say
,
The
Baptism
of
Christ
;
and
critically
elaborate
about
the
curves
,
the
gentle
blendings
,
the
diffusiveness
,
the
suggestion
in
placidity
of
,
say
,
Corot
’
s
Mantes
.
Somewhere
,
a
careful
critical
evaluation
of
the
qualities
and
artistic
procedures
in
the
work
of
Piero
della
Francesca
would
meet
and
go
along
with
the
first
,
simple
feeling
that
it
was
“
hard
”
;
and
somewhere
such
an
evaluation
of
the
painting
by
Corot
would
go
along
with
the
feeling
that
it
was
“
soft
.
”
Hardness
and
softness
are
things
we
meet
because
we
’
re
alive
.
We
all
have
memories
of
the
softness
of
handkerchiefs
and
the
hardness
of
tables
;
and
we
can
renew
these
memories
any
hour
.
Even
as
we
think
of
a
four
inch
cube
of
steel
and
a
pulsating
pigeon
,
we
are
having
different
—
though
related
—
experiences
.
The
ideas
of
hardness
and
softness
belong
to
art
;
they
also
belong
to
physics
,
to
ontology
;
and
to
the
commonest
happening
of
the
commonest
hour
.
All
art
tries
to
show
hardness
and
softness
working
as
one
.
I
have
said
that
the
immediate
effect
of
a
painting
by
Piero
della
Francesca
is
that
of
hardness
;
but
Piero
,
being
an
artist
,
uses
his
severe
visual
presentations
to
get
to
the
suggestive
,
the
haunting
,
even
the
melting
:
that
is
,
the
soft
.
And
out
of
the
mistiness
and
suffusion
and
shadowed
roundnesses
of
Corot
,
emerges
something
of
form
,
something
stable
,
definite
,
self
-
contained
:
that
is
,
the
hard
.
We
,
ourselves
,
are
a
constant
interaction
of
hardness
and
softness
;
and
if
the
interaction
is
not
so
accurate
,
we
are
in
a
state
of
misfortune
.
In
Every
Aspect
of
Art
Softness
and
hardness
are
in
every
aspect
of
art
.
A
point
itself
,
being
both
sharp
and
a
circle
—
so
it
has
to
be
,
visually
—
is
a
presence
of
hardness
and
softness
.
Dots
,
another
way
of
saying
points
,
are
severe
dots
and
suggestive
dots
:
are
hard
dots
and
soft
dots
.
Lines
,
when
curved
,
make
for
softness
;
when
straight
,
hardness
.
A
powerful
line
is
both
wavering
and
assertive
.
Planes
maintain
the
drama
of
hardness
and
softness
.
It
is
quite
clear
that
a
circle
is
softer
than
an
oblong
tipped
at
an
angle
.
It
may
be
mentioned
here
that
one
of
the
things
Vuillard
does
is
to
take
planes
,
most
often
thought
of
as
angular
or
hard
,
and
give
them
softness
through
their
context
in
a
picture
;
and
through
color
.
Color
as
to
line
,
is
as
softness
is
to
hardness
.
The
making
one
of
reality
as
color
and
line
is
also
the
making
one
of
reality
as
softness
and
hardness
.
Every
painting
,
according
to
Aesthetic
Realism
,
is
an
exploration
of
ontological
possibility
.
When
a
painting
succeeds
,
reality
is
once
more
shown
in
its
newness
,
contrariness
,
diversity
—
yet
as
inevitable
,
orderly
,
one
.
Within
colors
,
there
are
hardness
and
softness
.
The
blending
of
colors
is
really
a
blending
of
hard
and
soft
effects
or
possibilities
;
of
arrest
and
continuity
.
And
we
all
of
us
can
feel
a
rigid
brown
or
a
nicely
floating
soft
blue
.
Volumes
,
quite
clearly
,
have
hardness
and
softness
.
A
cube
of
bread
does
something
dramatically
other
than
a
cube
of
steel
,
colored
brown
.
Pliability
and
rigidity
are
dramatic
in
physics
:
and
they
are
in
art
.
Composition
,
itself
,
is
a
presence
and
interaction
of
flow
and
precision
,
diversity
and
oneness
,
expansion
and
fixity
—
all
of
which
pairs
comment
on
the
meaning
of
softness
and
hardness
.
Expression
has
in
it
,
too
,
hardness
and
softness
.
This
can
best
be
seen
in
portraiture
.
The
face
is
a
constant
presentation
of
hardness
and
softness
.
Of
course
,
body
itself
is
.
The
simple
hardness
and
softness
of
physics
,
or
of
ordinary
reality
,
is
to
be
seen
in
the
full
implication
of
words
,
phrases
,
and
sentences
used
in
the
history
of
art
criticism
.
Of
course
,
the
terms
hard
and
soft
,
and
hardness
and
softness
,
themselves
are
used
.
One
of
the
things
we
can
gather
from
the
history
of
art
and
art
criticism
is
that
hardness
unaccompanied
by
softness
or
flow
makes
for
unsuccessful
art
;
and
that
softness
unaccompanied
by
hardness
or
definition
likewise
makes
for
unsuccessful
art
.
Cubism
and
Surrealism
Cubism
,
in
its
use
of
geometrical
figures
,
accurately
and
intensely
related
,
brought
out
a
flowingness
or
“
softness
”
of
relation
among
rigidities
.
Surrealism
,
when
watches
were
made
soft
,
and
typewriters
mingled
with
viscera
,
likewise
attempted
to
present
objects
or
reality
as
soft
and
hard
at
once
.
Primitive
painting
,
most
often
,
uses
“
hard
”
immediate
effects
to
make
for
a
meaning
that
is
soft
,
wide
,
and
deeply
lingering
;
Giotto
,
where
he
can
be
seen
as
“
primitive
,
”
is
a
most
meaningful
contrast
to
the
floating
,
soft
mobility
of
Correggio
,
who
,
as
an
artist
,
still
has
his
definition
or
hardness
.
It
would
be
interesting
,
I
think
,
to
note
the
presence
of
hardness
and
softness
in
one
way
or
another
,
in
some
effective
and
representative
criticism
of
our
time
.
I
believe
it
would
be
useful
to
employ
Thomas
Munro
’
s
Great
Pictures
of
Europe
(
1930
)
as
a
source
for
our
inquiry
.
Munro
(
page
178
)
points
out
the
hardness
of
Venetian
art
before
Bellini
.
He
writes
:
Alvise
Vivarini
,
Madonna
and
Saints
—
stiff
,
cramped
,
wooden
,
sharp
-
edged
figures
,
basically
sculptural
;
they
show
the
state
of
Venetian
art
before
Bellini
.
Mantegna
,
St
.
George
—
small
but
concentrated
in
lustre
and
grace
of
line
.
Here
Munro
points
to
something
“
soft
”
—
“
grace
of
line
”
—
in
Mantegna
and
to
something
“
hard
”
—
“
stiff
,
cramped
,
wooden
,
sharp
-
edged
figures
”
—
in
Vivarini
.
However
,
elsewhere
in
his
work
,
Munro
comments
on
Mantegna
’
s
Calvary
.
Here
we
find
that
Mantegna
has
something
more
than
“
grace
of
line
”
;
he
is
both
hard
and
soft
.
This
is
clear
in
the
following
sentence
:
“
The
distinctive
element
here
is
the
use
of
long
,
sharp
,
flowing
lines
.
”
The
fact
that
Mantegna
’
s
lines
are
both
sharp
and
flowing
shows
that
there
are
both
hardness
and
softness
in
his
work
.
One
of
the
Many
Dramas
Then
Munro
says
that
later
Venetian
painting
“
softened
”
the
lines
of
Mantegna
.
We
have
seen
that
Mantegna
did
not
avoid
grace
,
or
flowingness
,
or
softness
as
such
.
The
following
passage
is
about
one
of
the
many
,
many
dramas
of
hardness
and
softness
which
,
in
all
kinds
of
combinations
,
we
find
in
the
history
of
art
:
Their
basic
structure
is
firm
:
tall
verticals
against
intersecting
,
receding
diagonals
.
Over
them
the
small
details
engrave
a
winding
scroll
-
work
of
unnatural
clarity
,
emphasized
by
long
linear
streaks
of
light
.
Later
Venetian
painting
softened
such
lines
with
richer
color
and
melted
them
into
plainer
masses
.
The
direct
effect
on
the
eye
is
somewhat
edgy
,
acrid
,
cramped
,
ungrateful
.
But
such
qualities
are
more
consistent
with
the
pain
,
the
agony
and
pity
represented
than
are
the
suavity
and
sensuous
richness
found
in
later
treatments
of
the
same
subject
.
So
just
as
Mantegna
added
grace
to
Vivarini
,
later
Venetians
added
softness
to
Mantegna
.
The
passage
I
have
quoted
contains
a
continuous
facing
,
mingling
,
and
antagonism
of
“
hard
”
and
“
soft
”
notions
.
The
soft
is
served
by
such
words
as
receding
,
winding
,
scroll
-
work
,
softened
,
color
,
melted
,
suavity
,
sensuous
,
richness
;
the
hard
by
such
words
as
structure
,
form
,
tall
,
verticals
,
intersecting
,
diagonals
,
linear
,
edgy
,
acrid
,
cramped
.
A
word
like
light
is
of
both
hardness
and
softness
;
however
,
it
may
be
said
that
light
is
harder
than
shadow
.
Then
there
is
the
word
clarity
:
clarity
to
unclearness
is
as
hardness
is
to
softness
.
Munro
accents
the
softness
in
Constable
(
p
.
13
)
.
The
critic
compares
Constable
’
s
Haywain
to
Hobbema
’
s
Woody
Landscape
:
The
Constable
is
far
more
colorful
,
rich
and
luminous
,
with
a
soft
iridescence
that
seems
to
penetrate
deep
into
the
inner
substance
of
trees
,
grass
and
soil
.
Further
,
Munro
writes
:
He
is
not
interested
in
brilliant
,
direct
sunlight
,
or
in
bright
decorative
color
;
but
in
merging
all
parts
of
his
landscape
by
soft
transitions
into
one
deep
,
continuous
whole
.
In
this
last
passage
,
the
relation
of
deep
to
continuous
is
as
hard
to
soft
.
But
the
word
whole
with
its
clear
unity
is
what
brings
the
necessary
hardness
or
definition
to
Constable
’
s
grace
,
luminosity
,
softness
.
Rembrandt
:
Hardness
and
Softness
Rembrandt
has
been
long
seen
as
the
sober
,
enchanting
master
of
light
and
shade
.
(
As
I
have
said
,
in
reality
,
as
in
art
,
light
corresponds
to
hardness
and
softness
to
shade
.
)
Munro
’
s
work
contains
a
critique
(
page
246
)
of
Rembrandt
’
s
The
Man
with
the
Gold
Helmet
,
which
is
a
striking
,
almost
a
bravura
making
one
of
hardness
and
softness
.
Munro
,
I
think
,
is
saying
in
the
following
passages
that
Rembrandt
made
rigidity
and
flowingness
,
hardness
and
softness
one
:
Rembrandt
is
akin
to
Leonardo
da
Vinci
…
in
his
reliance
upon
soft
,
mysterious
shadows
as
the
basis
of
his
form
.
“
Soft
,
mysterious
shadows
”
as
to
“
form
”
is
,
I
think
,
as
softness
is
to
hardness
.
In
other
words
,
Rembrandt
has
shown
that
hardness
and
softness
are
part
of
one
artistic
purpose
,
one
artistic
conclusion
.
The
shadows
are
never
drab
and
dead
,
the
modelling
never
hard
and
sculptural
,
the
transitions
from
dark
to
light
never
flashily
theatrical
—
all
faults
common
in
Leonardo
.
Said
otherwise
,
what
one
might
expect
to
be
only
hard
or
soft
are
both
in
a
rich
manner
:
the
shadows
move
,
are
not
“
dead
,
”
even
while
they
are
clearly
shadows
;
the
modelling
,
while
being
undoubtedly
modelling
,
is
never
“
hard
and
sculptural
”
;
the
transitions
from
dark
to
light
,
while
definitely
transitions
,
are
never
“
flashily
theatrical
.
”
Munro
’
s
statement
implies
that
the
relation
of
hardness
and
softness
in
Rembrandt
’
s
painting
is
rich
and
continuous
,
as
that
of
dancers
gracefully
taking
each
other
’
s
places
in
a
dance
around
the
Maypole
.
The
continuous
mystery
of
hard
and
soft
,
the
grandeur
in
subtlety
of
hardness
and
softness
—
as
of
light
and
dark
—
are
felt
with
beautiful
justice
by
Rembrandt
.
Another
passage
of
Munro
with
the
friendly
opposition
of
hardness
and
softness
in
it
is
:
“
The
face
is
stern
,
rugged
,
worn
,
but
with
a
hint
of
kindly
softening
in
the
lines
about
the
eyes
.
”
However
,
the
whole
comment
of
Munro
is
concerned
with
how
in
a
picture
of
a
soldier
with
a
gold
helmet
the
yieldingness
of
the
world
has
been
seen
by
Rembrandt
as
at
one
with
its
resistance
.
The
soft
beard
,
for
example
,
merges
with
the
hard
helmet
.
Something
like
this
is
going
on
everywhere
in
the
painting
.
And
Rembrandt
’
s
purpose
and
technique
are
reflected
in
the
critic
’
s
words
.
Reality
is
hard
and
soft
.
The
meaning
of
these
two
adjectives
is
endless
.
They
are
like
matter
and
space
;
they
are
like
rest
and
motion
;
death
and
life
.
Art
shows
that
the
immediate
significance
of
the
hard
and
that
of
the
soft
,
and
the
permanent
significance
,
are
one
.
How
lovely
this
is
,
how
important
this
is
,
I
think
we
have
yet
to
know
.

Hard
and
soft
Art
,
Literature
/

Timotheus
Vermeulen

Metamodernism
is
above
all
about
oscillation
.
Or
at
least
for
me
it
is
.
It
is
about
the
oscillation
between
the
modern
and
the
postmodern
,
history
and
ahistoricity
,
optimism
and
pessimism
,
sincerity
and
irony
,
the
concept
and
the
material
,
the
figurative
and
the
formless
,
narrative
and
the
plotless
,
discursive
originality
and
individual
intertextuality
,
meaning
and
meaninglessness
.
(
To
be
sure
,
contrary
to
what
the
above
might
suggest
,
it
is
not
so
much
about
the
oscillation
between
binary
opposites
,
as
between
the
various
ends
on
a
multidimensional
continuum
of
energies
and
intensities
.
)
One
oscillation
that
has
become
particularly
poignant
of
late
is
the
oscillation
between
what
might
perhaps
best
be
called
‘
hardness
’
and
‘
softness
’
.
Hardness
here
means
a
social
ruthlessness
and
austerity
as
well
as
a
physical
firmness
.
Softness
similarly
can
intend
both
sensitivity
or
empathy
and
the
smoothness
,
silkiness
or
furriness
of
a
substance
.
In
what
follows
,
I
briefly
explore
(
and
it
is
a
tentative
exploration
really
,
an
attempt
to
come
to
grips
with
)
two
exemplary
practices
.
The
brilliant
writing
of
Roberto
Bolano
is
illustrative
of
the
oscillation
between
hardness
and
softness
.
Bolano
’
s
style
is
frequently
epic
and
evocative
,
replete
with
grand
gestures
and
long
sentences
,
but
it
is
also
often
(
and
unfortunately
I
can
speak
about
the
English
translation
only
here
)
staccato
,
a
stop
-
motion
stream
of
hurried
and
barely
finished
sentences
and
interrupted
thoughts
.
Indeed
,
novels
like
2066
and
The
savage
detectives
create
a
narrative
fabric
,
it
seems
,
only
to
write
into
the
non
-
narrative
gaps
(
plot
lines
without
diegetic
past
or
future
)
.
Similarly
,
if
the
worlds
Bolano
narrates
are
frequently
terrible
and
terrifying
,
a
labyrinthic
,
grim
and
murky
setting
for
dispassionate
murders
,
calculated
violence
and
harsh
words
,
the
vagrants
,
poets
and
students
that
occupy
it
repeatedly
manage
to
establish
impossible
,
severely
flawed
yet
sincere
and
heartfelt
,
but
mostly
just
extremely
human
,
connections
.
Another
striking
example
is
the
work
of
the
French
artist
Cyprien
Gaillard
.
His
various
videos
,
installations
,
collages
and
paintings
all
concern
themselves
with
the
tension
between
modernist
architecture
and
nature
,
between
Reason
and
ruins
.
His
most
obviously
Romantic
piece
Belief
in
the
Age
of
Disbelief
(
2005
)
situates
a
modernist
housing
block
amidst
an
idyllic
17
^
th
century
Dutch
landscape
(
not
entirely
dissimilar
indeed
to
the
works
of
Peter
Doig
and
David
Thorpe
I
discussed
earlier
)
.
The
hard
,
straight
vertical
and
horizontal
lines
of
the
housing
block
contrast
with
the
softer
,
curved
,
undulated
lines
of
the
trees
and
the
hilltops
;
its
homogenous
anonymity
with
the
nature
’
s
inviting
diversity
.
Yet
surprisingly
,
the
housing
block
does
not
suppress
nature
,
but
appears
to
be
subsumed
by
it
;
instead
of
symbolizing
a
future
of
Reason
,
it
comes
to
represent
a
ruin
from
an
incomprehensible
,
mythical
past
.
In
his
more
recent
,
(
in
)
famous
Desniansky
Raion
(
2008
)
,
the
tension
between
modernism
and
nature
,
Reason
and
ruins
,
but
also
between
hardness
and
softness
paradoxically
becomes
both
unbearably
manifest
and
evasively
mythical
.
In
a
series
of
videos
,
Gaillard
monumentalizes
modernist
architecture
across
a
number
of
European
cities
.
In
the
first
video
,
modernist
buildings
outside
of
St
.
Petersburg
become
the
boxing
ring
for
massive
,
orchestrated
yet
completely
irrational
and
harrowing
fistfights
between
local
fight
clubs
(
evoking
18
^
th
century
battles
between
neighbouring
towns
)
.
In
the
second
section
,
a
Paris
housing
block
in
the
process
of
demolition
becomes
the
stage
for
an
estranging
,
otherworldly
light
show
(
tellingly
,
an
artistic
practice
usually
reserved
for
castles
,
ruins
and
monuments
)
.
And
in
the
third
part
,
an
Ukrainian
estate
comprised
of
high
,
anonymous
flats
,
is
turned
into
a
modern
Stonehenge
:
a
choreography
of
closed
,
silent
witnesses
of
a
past
whose
laws
,
rules
,
norms
and

For
that
is
what
Gaillard
’
s
work
is
about
:
by
pairing
the
modernist
architecture
with
transcendence
,
sensuality
and
aggression
,
that
is
,
by
coupling
the
hard
,
cold
and
calculated
to
the
indeterminable
and
fluent
,
Reason
to
the
irrational
,
the
past
future
to
the
future
past
,
he
tries
to
write
a
hauntology
,
that
is
,
tries
to
inscribe
the
inhuman
into
the
annals
of
human
myth
(
however
horrible
that
myth
may
be
)
.
In
Bolano
as
well
as
Gaillard

work
(
or
Djurberg
,
or
even
Eliasson
,
or
P

Anderson
,
or
The

)
the
unbearably
hardness
is
,
impossibly
,
at
the
same
time
the
sought
-
after
softness
.
A
(

)
modern
world
of
failed
utopias
,
missed
chances
and
cynical
deconstruction
is
represented
as
a
horrendous
,
terrible
place
;
but
a
place
,
still
,
a
lived
space
of
relationships
and
history
,
where
one
can
begin
to
try
and
live
again

Marine

Air
Station
Futenma
in
the
prefecture
'
s
Ginowan
city
.
(
Kyodo
)
In
a
post
on
X
,
formerly
Twitter
,
the
ministry
hailed
the
development
as
a
"
major
step
forward
for
the
full
return
of
Futenma
air
station
,
"
adding
it
will
continue
to
do
its
utmost
to
achieve
the
base
transfer
.
While
the
ministry
asserts
that
the
site
will
be
stabilized
to
support
the
base
,
the
project
may
encounter
challenges
due
to
some
areas
reportedly
reaching
depths
of
up
to
90
meters
below
sea
level
.
The
government
submitted
a
revised
landfill
plan
to
the
Okinawa
governor
in
April
2020
to
address
the
issue
of
soft
soil
.
After
the
Okinawa
prefectural
government
refused
to
approve
it
,
the
central
government
granted
approval
in
its
place
on
Dec
.
28
,
2023
.
Construction
work
is
expected
to
take
until
around
April
2033
,
while
arrangements
to
hand
the
facility
over
to
the
United
States
are
projected
to
take
an
additional
three
years
.
Tokyo
and
Washington
agreed
in
1996
to
return
the
land
used
for
Futenma
,
located
in
a
densely
populated
area
of
Ginowan
on
Okinawa
'
s
main
island
in
southern
Japan
.
The
Japanese
government
selected
the
coastal
Henoko
area
in
Nago
as
the
relocation
site
in
1999
,
but
the
plan
has
been
delayed
by
political
wrangling
and
strong
local
opposition
.
The
central
government
has
maintained
that
the
relocation
plan
is
the
"
only
"
solution
to
removing
the
dangers
posed
to
the
local
community
by
the
Futenma
base
without
undermining
the
perceived
deterrence
provided
by
the

Takeaways

Some
economists
foresee
a
“
soft
landing
”
in
2025
,
with
inflation
moving
lower
while
the
economy
remains
robust
and
unemployment
stays
low
.
*
However
,
some
predict
a
“
no
landing
”
scenario
where
the
economy
remains
strong
but
inflationary
pressures
remain
high
.
*
While
economists
see
a
recession
as
unlikely
,
some
said
policy
changes
like
higher
tariffs
could
weigh
on
economic
growth
.
Can
price
pressures
return
to
normal
in
2025
without
a
jump
in
unemployment
?
If
they
do
,
it
could
mean
the
“
soft
landing
”
investors
and
economists
have
been
watching
for
.
For
the
past
two
years
,
the
Federal
Reserve
has
worked
to
tame
inflation
and
cool
down
the
economy
without
tipping
it
into
a
recession
.
While
the
central
bank
didn
'
t
reach
its
annual
goal
of
2
%
inflation
in
2024
,
it
did
keep
a
lid
on
unemployment
,
and
the
economy
continued
its
growth
.
Some
economists
remain
hopeful
a
soft
landing
could
arrive
in
the
new
year
.
“
We
continue
to
believe
that
we
'
re
in
this
soft
landing
phase
where
U
.
S
.
economic
growth
remains
resilient
through
2025
,
”
said
Ashish
Shah
,
chief
investment
officer
of
public
investing
at
Goldman
Sachs
Asset
Management
.
Tracking
the
Chance
of
a
Soft
Landing
Economists
look
at
inflation
,
the
labor
market
,
gross
domestic
product
(
GDP
)
and
other
economic
indicators
when
watching
for
a
soft
landing
.
According
to
calculations
by
Wells
Fargo
,
the
probability
of
a
soft
landing
increased
two
percentage
points
from
their
last
estimate
to
42
%
when
taking
into
account
third
-
quarter
data
.
Meanwhile
,
the
probability
of
a
recession
decreased
by
the
same
amount
,
to
28
%
.
Their
research
also
examined
another
possibility
:
stagflation
,
in
which
inflation
rises
along
with
the
unemployment
rate
.
The
probability
of
that
scenario
was
lower
than
the
odds
of
a
recession
.
Inflation
Still
Needs
to
Fall
.
What
If
It
Doesn
'
t
?
The
Federal
Reserve
needs
price
pressures
to
slow
in
2025
to
achieve
a
soft
landing
.
Some
forecasts
indicate
that
the
risk
of
inflation
from
President
-
elect
Donald
Trump
'
s
policies
could
exacerbate
already
stubborn
inflation
.
“
Tariffs
stand
to
throw
some
sand
in
the
gears
of
economic
growth
next
year
and
stymie
inflation
'
s
return
to
the
Federal
Reserve
'
s
target
,
”
said
a
Wells
Fargo
note
from
a
group
of
analysts
headed
by
Chief
Economist
Jay
Bryson
.
In
addition
to
stubborn
inflation
,
many
economists
think
economic
growth
will
remain
strong
,
the
Federal
Reserve
will
keep
interest
rates
elevated
,
and
tariffs
are
likely
to
raise
prices
.
That
could
create
a
situation
in
which
there
'
s
no
landing
at
all
.
“
Instead
of
landing
,
the
U
.
S
.
economy
may
simply
refuel
next
year
,
”
wrote
Sal
Guatieri
,
senior
economist
at
BMO
.
What
About
a
Recession
?
A
soft
landing
would
be
a
rarity
for
the
Federal
Reserve
.
Out
of
the
last
nine
times
the
Fed
raised
rates
,
a
recession
ensued
after
eight
,
according
to
analysis
by
Piper
Sandler
.
However
,
this
time
,
a
recession
is
not
an
outcome
that
most
economists
think
is
likely
.
“
Our
suite
of
recession
models
showed
the
lowest
probability
of
recession
at
the
three
-
and
six
-
month
horizons
in
more
than
two
years
,
”
wrote
Matthew
Martin
,
senior
U
.
S
.
economist
at
Oxford
Economics
.
However
,
uncertainty
around
the
economy
,
especially
over
the
impact
of
tariffs
,
could
mean
that
economic
growth
comes
in
lower
than
expected
.
“
A
hard
landing
,
or
recession
,
is
not
our
base
case
,
but
the
risk
of
such
a
scenario
would
rise
in
the
event
of
severe
disruptions
to
global
trade
,
”
wrote
Wells
Fargo

GREAT
FALLS
—
A
beloved
fixture
of
downtown
Great
Falls
,
Candy
Masterpiece
,
will
close
its
doors
on
January
31
,
2025
,
marking
the
end
of
a
25
-
year
journey
that
has
brought
joy
and
sweetness
to
the
community
.
For
owner
Angie
Bruskotter
,
the
decision
to
close
the
store
was
a
bittersweet
one
.
Candy
Masterpiece
is
closing
after
25
sweet
years
in
Great
Falls
“
I
worked
in
the
corporate
world
for
quite
some
time
.
It
was
a
good
career
,
but
it
had
a
lifeless
attitude
to
it
,
”
Angie
shared
.
“
Then
it
came
up
that
there
was
a
little
candy
shop
called
Ranch
Girl
Wild
West
Confectionery
,
and
it
was
up
for
sale
.
”
That
decision
25
years
ago
transformed
Angie
’
s
life
and
brought
a
unique
,
whimsical
business
to
downtown
Great
Falls
.
Candy
Masterpiece
quickly
became
a
community
staple
,
drawing
customers
young
and
old
with
its
colorful
displays
and
nostalgic
treats
.
A
Difficult
Decision
While
Candy
Masterpiece
has
been
a
labor
of
love
,
Angie
explained
that
it
’
s
time
for
her
to
move
on
.
“
I
don
’
t
like
stress
.
I
just
don
’
t
.
It
took
me
three
years
to
make
this
decision
—
to
sell
it
,
muscle
up
,
and
close
it
down
,
”
she
said
.
“
I
thought
very
seriously
about
selling
it
,
but
I
know
businesses
that
have
been
up
for
sale
for
eight
years
.
For
me
,
it
just
wasn
’
t
worth
it
anymore
.

Angie
is
looking
forward
to
some
well
-
earned
downtime
.
“
I
’
m
going
to
take
two
months
off
and
veg
out
,
remember
who
I
am
,
do
some
art
,
work
in
my
yard
,
and
do
things
I
’
ve
been
neglecting
for
a
few
years
,
”
she
said
.
“
Then
I
’
m
going
to
go
back
to
school
and
become
a
massage
therapist
.
That
’
s
the
day
you
perish
—
when
you
stop
learning
.

A
Quarter
Century
of
Sweet
Memories
Over
the
years
,
Candy
Masterpiece
has
created
countless
cherished
memories
for
its
customers
.
Angie
recalls
many
special
moments
,
including
one
that
came
full
circle
.

“
There
was
a
little
girl
in
a
red
wagon
with
a
little
red
hat
named
Madeleine
.
She
found
the
shop
and
was
so
excited
,
”
Angie
said
.
“
A
few
years
ago
,
she
came
in
as
an
adult
with
her
kids
.
Those
are
some
of
my
favorite
experiences
—
seeing
people
who
are
still
coming
back
after
20
years
.

Despite
the
sadness
of
saying
goodbye
,
Angie
remains
optimistic
about
the
future
.
“
It
’
s
been
a
blast
.
I
’
m
going
to
miss
all
of
the
people
,
but
when
it
’
s
time
for
a
change
,
it
’
s
time
.
”
Shortly
after
news
of
the
closure
was
announced
,
many
people
asked
if
Bruskotter
would
consider
selling
the
business
to
a
new
owner
.
Candy
Masterpiece
posted
the
following
message
on
Facebook
to
address
the
issue
:
We
want
to
make
a
post
about
everyone
asking
about
if
Candy
Masterpiece
is
for
sale
.
We
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
Angie
is
not
interested
in
selling
the
business
and
to
please
stop
asking
.
We
understand
many
of
you
want
us
to
continue
and
we
love
that
you
enjoy
us
so
much
,
but
this
is
Angie
'
s
choice
and
we
kindly
ask
you
respect
her
decision
and
to
stop
asking
.
Thank
you
all
for
your
kind
words
and
we
hope
you
all
can
understand
and
see
this
from
ours
/
Angie
'
s
point
of
view
.
Thank
you
.
A
Fond
Farewell
As
Candy
Masterpiece
prepares
to
close
,
customers
are
invited
to
stop
by
,
reminisce
,
and
stock
up
on
their
favorite
treats
one
last
time
.
“
Did
you
have
fun
in
the
candy
shop
?
”
Angie
asked
a
young
customer
,
her
signature
warmth
on
full
display
.
“
Should
be
big
smiles
with
candy
now
!
”
Candy
Masterpiece
may
be
closing
,
but
its
legacy
of
joy
and
community
connection
will
remain
a
sweet
memory
for
Great
Falls
.
Until
they
close
,
you
can
still
visit
Candy
Masterpiece
at
120
Central
Avenue

Karan
Marwah
recently
had
the
“
most
luxurious
slow
-
roasted
sweet
potato
”
experience
of
his
life
in
Japan
recently
.
During
his
trip
,
he
visited
the
vibrant
and
upscale
district
of
Ginza
in
Tokyo
.
While
strolling
around
the
market
,
he
came
across
Tsubko
Yakiimo
,
a
traditional
sweet
potato
shop
.

In
this
shop
,
the
sweet
potatoes
are
sourced
from
some
of
the
best
of
the
farms
in
Japan
.
Then
,
these
premium
sweet
potatoes
are
slow
-
roasted
traditionally
in
big
clay
ovens
.
They
are
then
slow
-
roasted
for
more
than
three
hours
.
This
adds
a
smokey
flavour
to
the
melt
-
in
-
mouth
sweet
potatoes
which
are
called
‘
satsumaimo
’
.
For
half
a
slice
of
these
satsumaimo
,
Karan
paid
¥
650
,
which
is
almost
equivalent
to
₹350
.
Seeing
the
price
,
many
people
in
the
comments
section
were
flabbergasted
,
while
others
were
so
taken
by
the
way
it
was
roasted
that
they
wanted
to
visit
Japan
just
to
try
it
out
!

Satsumaimo
or
Japanese
sweet
potatoes
are
quite
popular
among
locals
.
In
fact
,
there
are
special
expos
held
in
cities
like
Osaka
,
Kanagawa
,
Shimane
,
and
Aichi
for
this
vegetable
.
When
slow
-
roasted
for
long
hours
,
the
natural
sugar
in
sweet
potatoes
caramelises
and
gives
it
a
smokey
,
sweet
flavour
,
without
forgoing
its
health
benefits
.
Satsumaimo
is
also
a
natural
fibre
supplement
.
It
is
rich
in
vitamins
C
and
E
and
can
help
prevent
obesity
,
prevent
digestive
system
diseases
,
and
even
strokes
.
All
this
makes
it
a
great
vegetable
to
add
to
meals
.

Santa
Cruz
,
Bolivia
–
In
the
heart
of
Santa
Cruz
,
Bolivia
,
a
charming
little
pastry
shop
is
delighting
locals
with
a
taste
of
France
.
Les
Petits
Macarons
,
the
dream
come
true
of
Honduran
migrant
Zamantha
,
has
quickly
become
a
beloved
spot
for
anyone
craving
the
satisfying
taste
of
macarons
.
Stepping
into
the
shop
,
customers
are
enveloped
in
the
irresistible
aroma
of
freshly
baked
macarons
.
These
delicate
,
meringue
-
based
treats
are
brightly
coloured
and
elegantly
displayed
against
a
backdrop
of
soft
pastels
and
graceful
chandeliers
,
evoking
the
enchanting
atmosphere
of
cozy
Parisian
patisseries
.
"
Each
bite
takes
you
on
a
journey
to
romantic
Paris
,
"
Zamantha
says
with
convincing
enthusiasm
.

For
Zamantha
,
31
,
running
this
entrepreneurship
means
more
than
a
business
,
it
is
a
dream
blossomed
during
her
travels
across
Europe
.
Her
journey
from
Honduras
to
Bolivia
was
sparked
by
love
–
a
serendipitous
romance
that
prompted
her
to
embark
on
a
gradual
process
of
starting
anew
in
a
new
land
in
2019
.
Since
opening
her
pastry
shop
in
2023
,
she
has
devoted
herself
into
sharing
the
joy
of
macarons
with
her
new
community
.
Juggling
the
demands
of
raising
two
young
children
while
nurturing
her
growing
business
,
Zamantha
’
s
arrival
in
Bolivia
also
meant
navigating
unfamiliar
customs
and
culture
.
“
It
is
not
always
a
walk
in
the
park
,
but
it
is
so
rewarding
,
”
she
says
.
“
I
want
my
children
to
understand
that
no
matter
where
you
come
from
,
hard
work
can
help
you
build
the
life
you
dream
of
.
”
Zamantha
’
s
menu
features
a
range
of
flavours
from
timeless
raspberry
to
unique
seasonal
specialities
crafted
with
local
ingredients
,
adapted
to
local
taste
.
With
Christmas
around
the
corner
,
she
is
preparing
festive
macarons
shaped
like
miniature
Christmas
trees
,
adding
a
touch
of
holiday
magic
to
her
offerings
.

The
response
from
customers
has
been
overwhelmingly
positive
,
as
locals
eagerly
embrace
these
sweet
confections
.
"
They
are
absolutely
delicious
.
I
haven
’
t
tasted
anything
this
good
in
ages
,
"
raves
Teresa
,
a
Bolivian
customer
who
has
become
a
regular
.
Zamantha
’
s
creations
showcase
her
culinary
talent
and
are
an
introduction
to
many
who
may
be
new
to
these
French
delicacies
.
“
I
love
showing
to
them
the
real
thing
,
”
she
smiles
,
highlighting
the
differences
between
macarons
and
similar
treats
like
Argentine
alfajores
.
Still
,
Zamantha
’
s
journey
has
not
been
without
its
bumps
.
As
a
migrant
starting
from
scratch
,
she
has
faced
many
challenges
but
tackled
each
one
with
determination
and
positivity
.
The
International
Organization
for
Migration
(
IOM
)
has
played
a
crucial
role
in
her
success
,
helping
her
navigate
her
entrepreneurial
path
.
"
The
potential
of
migrants
is
truly
limitless
,
"
says
Pamela
Fernandez
,
IOM
Head
of
Office
in
Bolivia
.
"
Their
talents
can
be
a
significant
lift
to
local
economies
.
"
In
macarons
,
Zamantha
found
a
creative
way
to
integrate
and
develop
her
own
business
in
her
new
city
.

.
This
initiative
includes
business
management
and
soft
skills
,
technical
support
for
business
plans
,
and
essential

.
“
By

sustainable
livelihoods
,
we
empower
migrants
to
integrate
into
the
workforce
and
contribute
to
the
socio
-
economic
development
of
their
host
communities
,
”
adds
Pamela
.
At

,
South
America
’
s

,
Zamantha
enthusiastically
shares
her
macarons
with
a
global
audience
,
eager
to
seize
every
opportunity
for
growth
.
"
Every
conversation
is
a
precious
opportunity
,
every
event
a
chance
to
share
my
vision
,
"
she
says
.
Thanks
to
the
new
partnerships
with
local
businesses
,
her
sales
have
recently
jumped
by
an
impressive
30
per
cent
.

sparked
divorce
rumors
when
trolls
started
speculating
that
they
were
subtweeting
each
other
via
Instagram
Stories
.
Social
media
users
started
speculating
,
yet
again
,
that
they
had
split
or
were
going
through
a
rough
patch
on
the
heels
of
his
ex
-
girlfriend
Selena
Gomez
'
s
engagement
.
On
December
11
,
the
actress
,
32
,
happily
announced
her
engagement
to
Benny
Blanco
after
only
a
year
-
and
-
a
-
half
of
dating
.
As
for
Hailey
and
Justin
'

marriage
,
a
source
close
to
the
couple
said
they
'
re
'
more
in

'
'
Hailey
has
seen

When
Justin
asked
Hailey
what
she
wanted
for
Christmas
this
year
,
she
really
couldn
'
t
think
of
anything
because
she
has
everything
she
could
ever
want
.
'
The
source
also
noted
how
the

'

discussed
having
more

,
they
'

I
absolutely
love
sweet
potatoes
.
I
make
sweet
potato
pancakes
,
sweet
potato
fries
,
sweet
potato
smoothies
,
sweet
potato
muffins
…
(
OK
,
now
I
’
m
starting
to
sound
like
Bubba
from
“
Forrest
Gump
”
)
.
My
1
-
year
-
old
son
even
had
mashed
sweet
potatoes
for
lunch
this
week
.
Keeping
with
the
theme
,
I
thought
it
was
totally
appropriate
to
make
Sweet
Potato
Pie
Stuffed
Biscuits
.
Sounds
amazing
,
right
?
I
love
homemade
buttered
biscuits
,
but
I
have
zero
time
to
make
them
,
so
I
often
buy
pre
-
made
biscuits
.
My
family
loves
them
just
the
same
and
they
make
my
life
a
little
easier
.

WARNING
:
Spoilers
for
Squid
Game
season
2
and
Sweet
Home
.
No
-
eul
’
s
connection
to
the
little
girl
who
has
cancer
was
arguably
the
saddest
story
in
Squid
Game
season
2
,
yet
it
was
also
a
stealth
Sweet
Home
reunion
.
While
Squid
Game
season
1
became
Netflix
’
s
most
-
watched
show
of
all
time
,
it
was
not
the
first
K
-
drama
to
be
a
worldwide
hit
for
the
streamer
.
A
year
earlier
,
Sweet
Home
became
the
first
Korean
show
to
appear
on
Netflix
’
s
global
top
10
and
opened
the
door
for
more
original
K
-
dramas
on
the
platform
.
Although
Sweet
Home
and
Squid
Game
are
very
different
shows
,
they
share
some
similarities
.
Just
like
Squid
Game
,
Sweet
Home
season
2
also
took
three
years
to
arrive
after
a
very
successful
first
season
.
Likewise
,
Sweet
Home
produced
seasons
2
and
3
back
-
to
-
back
,
with
the
third
and
final
season
arriving
less
than
a
year
later
.
This
is
exactly
what
is
happening
with
Squid
Game
season
3
.
Another
similarity
is
the
themes
of
survival
and
teamwork
,
although
Squid
Game
is
a
much
more
grounded
show
than
Sweet
Home
.
Lastly
,
Squid
Game
and
Sweet
Home
share
some
actors
,
with
Park
Gyu
-
young
and
Lee
Jin
-
wook
playing
key
roles
in
both
shows
.
Park
Gyu

And
Lee

Both

No

eul
and
Gyeong
-
seok
’
s
story
in
Squid
Game
season
2
was
a
small
Sweet
Home
reunion
.
Before
starring
in
Squid
Game
,
Park
Gyu
-
young
broke
big
as
Yoon
Ji
-
su
in
Sweet
Home
’
s
seasons
1
and
2
.
While
Netflix
’
s
Sweet
Home
made
some
big
changes
to
the
webtoon
on
which
the
K
-
drama
was
based
,
including
the
relationship
between
Ji
-
su
and
Cha
Hyun
-
su
,
Park
Gyu
-
young
’
s
character
was
one
of
the
best
things
about
the
show
.
Unfortunately
,
Ji
-
su
’
s
story
was
cut
short
in
Sweet
Home
season
2
,
with
Park
Gyu
-
young
not
returning
for
season
3
.

also

in

having
played
more

character
on
the
show

In

.
Although
Sang

wook
died
at
the
end
of

,
his
body
was

by
a
different

Na

giving
No

the

In
what
was
perhaps
the
biggest
plot
twist
of
the
season
,
Park
Gyu
-
young
was
not
playing
another
contestant
in
Squid

2
but
rather
one
of
the
pink
guards
.
To
make
things
more

,
Na

Gyeong

Tampa
Bay
Buccaneers
quarterback
Baker
Mayfield
surprised
his
offensive
linemen
with
quite
the
delicious
gift
this
week
.
Mayfield
had
personalized
sugar
cookies
made
with
their
jersey
numbers
and
names
on
it
.
He
also
gave
them
a
huge
glass
of
whole
milk
,
which
really
surprised
a
lot
of
the
players
.
In
a
funny
moment
,
offensive
tackle
Tristan
Wirfs
even
asked
if
the
milk
was
"
900
calories
.
"
The
players
indulged
in
the
cookies
and
the
milk
in
the
locker
room
.
Of
course
,
the
players
had
to
dip
the
cookies
in
the
milk
glasses
.
They
really
seemed
to
enjoy
the
cookies
and
couldn
'
t
stop
thanking
Mayfield
for
the
sweet
gift
.
The
Buccaneers
'
social
media
account
made
a
pun
regarding
the
situation
,
saying
that
"
They
call
him
Baker
for
a
reason

This
April
,
John
marked
what
would
have
been
Jett
'
s
32nd
birthday
on
Instagram
,
writing
:
'
Happy
birthday

Jetty

where
you
’
re
not

'
One
month
later
on
Mother
'
s
Day
,
he
posted
a
picture
of
Kelly
with
Ella
and
Benjamin
,
captioned
:
'
Happy
Mother
’
s
Day
Kelly
.
We
love
you
we
miss
you
.
'
The
family
was
struck
by
bereavement
yet
again
when
Kelly
died
in
July
2020
,
two
years
after
she
was
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
.
John
heartbrokenly
announced
her
death
and
thanked
her
medical
team
,
writing
:
'
My
family
and
I
will
forever
be
grateful
to
her
doctors
and
nurses
at
MD
Anderson
Cancer
Center
,
all
the
medical
centers
that
have
helped
.
'
The
post
ignited
rumors
that
John
and
Kelly
had
drifted
away
from
Scientology
,
whose
founder
L
.
Ron
Hubbard
was
against
chemotherapy
and
radiation
.
However
the
Church
Of
Scientology
'
s
website
does
urge
believers
to
'
seek
conventional
medical
treatment
for
illnesses
and
injuries
.
'
This
Mother
'
s
Day
,
John
touchingly
posted
a
picture
of
Ella
and

their
late
mother
Kelly
Preston

who
succumbed

Preston

John
spoke
candidly
about
his
grieving
process
in
the
year
following
Kelly
'
s
death
,
in
a
2021
profile
interview
he
gave
to
Esquire
Spain
.
'
I
learned
that
crying
and
mourning
over
someone
is
something
personal
.
Mourning
is
individual
and
experiencing
your
own
journey
is
what
can
lead
to
healing
,
'
he
said
.
'
The
most
important
thing
you
can
do
to
help
another
when
they
are
in
mourning
is
allow
them
to
live
it
and
not
complicate
it
with
yours
,
'
John
observed
.
'
Let
'
s
say
you
lose
someone
and
at
the
funeral
you
are
very
sad
,
then
another
person
approaches
you
who
is
feeling
more
sadder
and
doesn
'
t
leave
enough
space
for
you
to
mourn
.
It
would
be
like
two
boats
plummeting
to
the
bottom
.
That
is
my
experience
,
'
the
Pulp
Fiction
star
explained
.
'
I
felt
saturated
with
everyone
'
s
sadness
that
I
didn
'
t
know
what
to
do
.
The
first
thing
you
should
do
when
you
experience
grief
is
to
go
to
a
place
where
you
can
mourn
,
without
any
interference
,

added

State
officials
are
making
a
concerted
effort
to
position
Louisiana
as
a
leader
in
the
realm
of
AI
—
and
that
effort
appears
to
be
paying
off
.
Early
this
month
,
it
was
announced
that
Meta
,
the
parent
company
of
Facebook
and
Instagram
,
is
planning
to
build
a
$
10
billion
AI
data
center
in
Richland
Parish
.
Just
days
later
,
it
was
revealed
that
Hut
8
,
a
bitcoin
miner
headquartered
in
Miami
,
is
planning
to
build
a
similarly
massive
AI
data
center
in
West
Feliciana
Parish
.
And
officials
have
hinted
that
more
announcements
are
on
the
horizon
.
But
what
is
it
exactly
that
’
s
making
Louisiana
so
attractive
to
these
out
-
of
-
state
tech
giants
?
Louisiana
Economic
Development
Secretary
Susan
Bourgeois
tells
Daily
Report
that
there
are
three
key
factors
to
consider
:
*
Land
availability
:
Large
-
scale
projects
like
data
centers
require
large
swaths
of
land
with
reliable
access
to
infrastructure
.
Louisiana
has
ample
land
suitable
for
such
projects
.
*
Energy
capacity
:
Speed
to
market
is
something
that
’
s
highly
valued
in
the
tech
industry
,
and
Louisiana
’
s
energy
providers
are
capable
of
bringing
additional
power
generation
online
rapidly
.
*
Workforce
readiness
:
While
Louisiana
’
s
workers
may
not
yet
be
trained
in
emerging
fields
like
AI
,
LED
’
s
partnership
with
the
Louisiana
Community
and
Technical
College
System
enables
the
rapid
development
of
tailored
training
programs
to
equip
them
with
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed
in
such
industries
.
“
There
are
other
states
that
have
some
of
those
things
,
but
not
all
of
those
things
,
”
Bourgeois
says
.
“
They
might
have
one
or
two
of
the
three
,
but
Louisiana
is
in
a
sweet
spot
.
”
When
asked
how
LED
is
working
to
ensure
Louisiana
’
s
continued
viability
as
a
tech
hub
,
Bourgeois
points
to
her
organization
’
s
proactive
approach
to
AI
as
a
critical
driver
of
future
growth
.
“
AI
is
the
future
of
technology
as
we
know
it
,
and
everyone
’
s
trying
to
get
ahead
of
this
thing
,
”
she
says
.
“
What
folks
in
Louisiana
should
both
know
and
hopefully
be
very
proud
of
is
that
we
’
re
not
sitting
back
being
reactionary
to
this
.
”
More
specifically
,
Bourgeois
envisions
a
near
future
in
which
Louisiana
serves
as
something
of
a
“
lab
”
for
AI
application
.
That
’
s
because
the
state
’
s
existing
expertise
in
fields
like
agriculture
,
defense
and
water
management
provides
a
strong
foundation
for
testing
and
implementing
innovative
AI
solutions
that
can
address
real
-
world
challenges
.
“
No
one
’
s
out
ahead
of
AI
yet
because
it
’
s
all
happening
so
quickly
,
”
Bourgeois
says
.
“
Louisiana
is
very

(

)
—
The
Lackawanna
County
Children
’
s
Library
is
making
science
fun
for
kids
with
its
Curiosity
Club
,
a
free
STEM
program
for
preschool
to
third
-
grade
students
.
Today
,
young
scientists
explored
the
sweet
science
of
candy
canes
in
a
hands
-
on
learning
experience
.
Kids
experimented
with
baking
soda
and
vinegar
to
make
candy
canes
“
dance
,
”
tested
how
different
liquids
dissolve
the
sweet
treats
,
and
even
learned
whether
candy
canes
sink
or
float
.
“
This
is
a
program
that
anybody
can
come
in
;
they
don
’
t
need
to
pay
anything
.
We
know
that
a
lot
of
schools
don
’
t
always
offer
things
that
they
used
to
anymore
,
so
this
is
an
opportunity
for
kids
to
learn
different
things
that
they
might
not
get
to
in
school
in
a
fun
way
,
"
said
Jenna
O
'
Malley
,
early
childhood
program
coordinator
at
Lackawanna
Children
'
s
Library
.
The
classes
are
every
fourth
Saturday
of
the
month
,
requiring
only
a
library
card
.
Next
month
,
the
Curiosity
Club
will
dive
into
the
freezing
points
of
water
,
with
kids
trying
their
hand
at
indoor
ice
fishing

(

Instagram
)
Kristin
Cavallari
recalled
her
“
sweet
”
date
with
Morgan
Wallen
.
On
December
30
,
during
her
appearance
on
the
Dumb
Blonde
podcast
hosted
by
Bunnie
XO
,
wife
of
country
singer
Jelly
Roll
,
the
TV
personality
addressed
her
rumored
romance
with
the
country
music
star
.
The
Hills
alum
confirmed
that
she
“
definitely
hung
out
”
with
Wallen
and
called
him
a
good
guy
with
a
big
heart
.
“
The
first
date
that
we
went
on
,
he
was
a
true
gentleman
.
He
’
s
like
,
‘
I
’
ll
pick
you
up
;
I
’
ll
pick
the
place
,
’
”
she
recalled
.
Cavallari
recalled
him
meeting
her
three
kids
—
sons
Camden
and
Jaxon
and
daughter
Saylor
—
who
were
“
so
excited
”
upon
the
introduction
.
"
(
Wallen
)
got
us
a
private
room
with
his
bodyguard
.
He
dropped
me
off
.
He
kissed
me
in
the
rain
.
And
it
was
the
sweetest
thing
.
We
hung
out
thereafter
,
"
she
added
.
Although
their
brief
romance
was
"
sweet
,
”
it
had
its
highs
and
lows
.
She
revealed
that
Wallen
was
the
first
man
in
her
life
who
was
not
completely
“
enamored
”
with
her
.
"
It
really
threw
me
,
"
she
added
.
The
couple
were
rumored
to
be
dating
in
2023
,
and
during
her
appearance
on
Watch
What
Happens
Live
with
Andy
Cohen
in
September
,
she
put
the
rumors
to
rest
.
He
claimed
that
she
was
not
dating
Wallen
at
the
time
.
However
,
when
host
Andy
Cohen
asked
if
she
went
on
a
date
with
him
,
Cavallari
coyly
responded
,
“
I
don
’
t
know
,
I
don
’
t
know
,
”
then
pretended
to
zip
her
lips
shut
.

In
an
interview
with
Entertainment
Tonight
,
Cavallari
admitted
that
she
was
“
done
dating
in
Nashville
”
and
took
the
“
guarantee
”
that
she
wouldn
’
t
settle
down
with
the
country
music
star
.
"
I
would
consider
myself
to
be
a
monk
at
this
point
.
You
can
throw
anything
at
me
,
and
I
'
m
like
,
'
OK
,
'
"
she
added
.
Cavallari
has
also
been
romantically
linked
to
country
singer
Chase
Rice
,
comedian
Jeff
Dye
,
and
Bachelor
Nation
alum
Tyler
Cameron
since
her
2020
split
from
ex
-
husband
Jay
Cutler
.
The
exes
continue
to
co
-
parent
their
three
kids
.
"
I
'
ve
realized
,
what
'
s
going
to
drive
someone
the
craziest
?
Not
giving
them
a
reaction
,
"

said
at
the
time

Michelle
Brnjac
surveyed
the
storefront
with
growing
optimism
,
recognizing
the
potential
with
each
passing
glance
.
Then
came
the
closer
.
“
Out
back
you
can
still
see
the
outline
of
the
old
sign
‘
Welcome
to
Quality
’
,
”
said
the
newly
-
arriving
baker
,
referring
to
238
Main
Street
’
s
historic
Quality
Greens
.
“
As
soon
as
I
saw
quality
I
knew
this
was
it
.
That
’
s
our
slogan
,
where
flavour
meets
quality
.
”
With
that
final
bit
of
assurance
,
Brnjac
sealed
the
deal
on
relocating
her
family
-
run
Eat
My
Sweets
!
from
a
tucked
away
corner
in
Streetsville
to
its
high
visibility
new
digs
in
downtown
Milton
.
“
It
’
s
a
blessing
,
and
quite
the
learning
curve
if
I
’
m
being
honest
.
Where
we
were
before
there
wasn
’
t
a
lot
of
traffic
,
”
said
the
George
Brown
College
baking
and
pastry
arts
management
graduate
.
“
We
’
re
kind
of
centre
stage
here
,
so
we
’
re
learning
a
new
flow
and
rhythm
.
It
’
s
kind
of
hard
to
miss
us
now
.
It
’
s
a
bit
of
a
paradigm
shift
.
”
What
remains
constant
for
the
relocated
bakery
–
established
seven
-
and
-
a
-
half
years
ago
–
is
its
vision
of
offering
100
per
cent
peanut
and
tree
nut
free
treats
.
And
a
whole
lot
of
them
.

Steve
LeBlanc

That
inspiration
was
sparked
during
Brnjac
’
s
post
-
secondary
studies
,
when
the
need
for
nut
-
free
workplace
and
school
environments
was
first
gaining
widespread
attention
.
Furthermore
,
some
family
friends
with
nut
allergies
put
a
personal
perspective
on
the
matter
.
Recalled
Brnjac
,
“
Just
watching
them
when
we
’
d
go
places
,
they
’
d
always
have
to
ask
(
about
desserts
)
and
always
have
to
be
so
cautious
.
To
me
,
it
felt
wrong
.
They
kind
of
got
the
short
end
of
the
stick
.
”
Holding
firm
to
the
idea
that
taste
doesn
’
t
need
to
be
sacrificed
to
ensure
safety
–
viewing
this
as
“
putting
salt
in
an
open
wound
”
–
the
local
bakery
owner
says
having
a
completely
nut
-
free
menu
isn
’
t
as
challenging
as
many
may
believe
.
At
least
from
a
creative
standpoint
.
“
For
a
lot
of
things
the
nuts
are
more
of
an
addition
or
garnish
of
…
it
’
s
optional
,
”
said
Brnjac
,
whose
Croatian
and
Italian
heritage
offered
plenty
of
family
influences
for
her
career
to
come
.
“
In
some
cases
you
need
to
reinvent
the
wheel
a
bit
,
but
it
’
s
not
as
difficult
as
people
think
.
”
Opening
Eat
My
Sweets
!
after
years
spent
in
the
event
planning
food
industry
,
she
and
her
staff
remain
vigilant
to
ensure
no
traces
of
peanuts
and
tree
nuts
come
in
contact
with
any
of
their
offerings
.
That
means
always
being
mindful
of
labels
,
and
switching
ingredients
whenever
the
‘
may
contain
’
warning
comes
into
play
.
There
’
s
also
the
minimum
24
-
hour
safety
net
between
handling
any
peanut
products
and
starting
a
work
shift
,
to
protect
those
whose
allergic
reactions
are
triggered
by
inhalation
as
much
as
ingestion
.
While
offering
a
few
cupcakes
as
an
intro
point
for
kids
just
starting
to
explore
the
world
of
nut
-
free
desserts
,
the
business
focuses
more
on
a
wide
variety
of
brownies
,
blondies
and
squares
–
as
well
as
some
more
unique
dishes
like
French
galettes
.
Custom
orders
are
always
available
,
while
seasonal
offerings
and
home
-
made
jams
of
Brnjac
’
s
aunt
add
to
the
sweet
spectrum
of
choices
.
Among
the
more
popular
ones
are
the
mixed
berry
square
–
which
was
initially
thought
to
be
only
a
seasonal
addition
–
and
the
aptly
-
named
‘
blackout
’
brownie
.
“
It
’
s
kind
of
a
chocolate
overload
,
it
’
s
best
to
eat
it
in
small
doses
,
”
quipped
Brnjac
,
who
’
d
originally
looked
to
become
a
chef
before
a
close
call
with
undercooked
chicken
in
a
Grade
11
hospitality
class
left
her
“
discombobulated
”
and
readjusting
her
career
path
.
Unbeknownst
to
the
Eat
My
Sweets
!
owner
until
considering
a
new
location
earlier
this
year
was
the
fact
that
many
of
her
longtime
customers
were
actually
from
Milton
.
“
When
I
said
I
was
thinking
of
coming
here
they
said
‘
Michelle
,
you
have
no
idea
how
big
a
base
(
for
nut
-
free
sweets
)
there
is
in
Milton
.
I
’
m
super
blessed
;
everything
fell
into
place
at
the
right
time

Sweetness

(

)
.
Sweetness
and
light
is
an
English
idiom
that
can
be
used
in
common
speech
,
either
as
statement
of
personal
happy
consciousness
,
(
though
this
may
be
viewed
by
natives
as
being
a
trifle
in
earnest
)
or
as
literal
report
on
another
person
.
Depending
upon
sense
-
of
-
humour
,
some
may
use
the
phrase
with
mild
irony
.
For
example
:
The
two
had
been
fighting
for
a
month
,
but
around
others
it
was
all
sweetness
and
often
,
sometimes
with
a
slight
nod
to
the
phrase
'
s
dual
-
edge
.
Originally
,
however
,
"
sweetness
and
light
"
had
a
special
use
in
literary
and
cultural
criticism
meaning
"
pleasing
and
instructive
"
,
which
in
classical
theory
was
considered
to
be
the
aim
and
Jonathan
Swift
first
used
the
phrase
in
his
mock
-
heroic
prose
satire
,
"
The
Battle
of
the
Books
"
(
1704
)
,
a
defense
of
Classical
learning
,
which
he
published
as
a
prolegomenon
to
his
A
Tale
of
a
Tub
.
It
gained
widespread
currency
in
the
Victorian
era
,
when
English
poet
and
essayist
Matthew
Arnold
picked
it
up
as
the
title
of
the
first
section
of
his
1869
book
Culture
and
Anarchy
:
An
Essay
in
Political
and
Social
Criticism
,
where
"
sweetness
and
light
"
stands
for
beauty
and
intelligence
,
the
two
key
components
of
an
excellent
culture
.
Genesis
"
The
Battle
of
the
Books
"
spoofed
the
famous
seventeenth
-
century
Quarrel
of
the
Ancients
and
the
Moderns
,
a
controversy
that
had
raged
first
in
France
and
then
,
less
intensely
,
in
England
,
about
which
was
better
,
the
Ancient
or
Modern
learning
.
Should
people
model
their
thinkings
and
creative
productions
on
ancient
Greek
and
Latin
culture
,
which
had
been
rediscovered
in
Europe
from
the
Renaissance
on
?
Or
should
they
stay
faithful
to
medieval
modernity
,
scholasticism
and
the
authority
of
Christian
monarchy
and
church
;
and
create
artistic
works
in
living
vernacular
languages

not
Greek
or
Latin
)

1697
)
,
Swift
'
s
patron
,
the
urbane
Sir
William
Temple
,
had
weighed
in
on
the
side
of
the
Ancients
,
repeating
the
famous
figure
of
speech
used
by
Newton
,
that
the
moderns
see
further
only
because
we
are
dwarves
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
.
Swift
has
the
books
come
to
life
and
step
down
from
the
library
shelves
to
stage
a
mock
-
Homeric
battle
,
while
the
goddess
Criticism
,
a
hideous
hag
,
intervenes
on
the
side
of
Midway
through
the
story
,
Aesop
,
an
ancient
book
,
stumbles
on
a
debate
between
a
bee
and
a
spider
.
The
spider
claims
that
the
bee
creates
nothing
of
its
own
,
whereas
the
spider
is
an
original
creator
who
"
spins
and
spits
wholly
from
himself
,
and
scorns
to
own
any
obligation
or
assistance
from
without
"
;
his
web
is
a
triumph
of
architecture
and
mathematics
.
The
bee
counters
that
the
spider
'
s
web
is
spun
from
digested
flies
and
other
dirt
and
that
all
the
spider
really
contributes
is
his
poison
.
Bees
range
far
and
wide
to
search
out
the
very
best
flowers
,
which
they
do
not
harm
,
while
the
spider
only
moves
Aesop
judges
the
argument
.
The
ancient
writers
,
he
says
,
are
like
bees
who
fill
their
"
hives
with
honey
and
wax
,
thus
furnishing
mankind
with
authors
results
in
works
filled
with
delight
(
sweetness
)
and
moral
wisdom
(
light
)
.
Later
writers
,
notably
Matthew
Arnold
used
the
phrase
"
sweetness
and
light
"
,
to
designate
the
positive
effects
of
a
(
predominantly
classical
)
humanistic
culture
in
arts
and
letters
(
without
Swift
'
s
emphasis
on
originality
versus
imitation
)
.
Popularization
in
cultural
criticism
The
Victorian
poet
and
essayist
Matthew
Arnold
,
who
was
also
an
inspector
of
schools
,
popularized
Swift
'
s
phrase
as
the
theme
and
title
of
the
first
chapter
of
his
celebrated
book
of
cultural
criticism
,
Culture
and
Anarchy
.
Arnold
contends
that
the
most
valuable
aspect
of
civilization
is
its
ability
to
confer
"
sweetness
and
light
,
"
and
he
contrasts
this
to
the
moralism
,
hatred
,
and
fanaticism
of
some
of
the
would
-
be
educators
and
materialistic
improvers
of
mankind
.
For
Arnold
,
sweetness
is
beauty
,
and
light
is
intelligence
–
and
together
they
make
up
"
the
essential
character
of
human
perfection
,
"
which
had
its
fullest
Arnold
criticizes
the
religious
and
utilitarian
reformers
of
his
own
day
for
wanting
only
to
improve
humanity
'
s
moral
and
material
condition
,
or
for
focusing
"
solely
on
the
scientific
passion
for
knowing
,
"
while
neglecting
the
human
need
for
beauty
and
intelligence
,
which
comes
about
through
lifelong
self
-
cultivation
.
Arnold
concedes
that
the
Greeks
may
have
neglected
the
moral
and
material
,
but
:
Greece
did
not
err
in
having
the
idea
of
beauty
and
harmony
and
complete
human
perfection
so
present
and
paramount
;
it
is
impossible
to
have
this
idea
too
present
and
paramount
;
but
the
moral
fiber
must
be
braced
too
.
And
we
,
because
we
have
braced
the
moral
fibre
,
are
not
on
that
account
in
the
right
way
,
if
at
the
same
time
the
idea
of
beauty
,
harmony
,
and
complete
human
perfection
is
wanting
or
misapprehended
amongst
us
;
and
evidently
it
is
wanting
or
misapprehended
at
present
.
And
when
we
rely
as
we
do
on
our
religious
organisations
,
which
in
themselves
do
not
and
cannot
give
us
this
idea
,
and
think
we
have
done
enough
if
we
make
them
spread
and
prevail
,
then
,
I
say
,
we
fall
into
our
common
fault
of
The
phrase
came
into
regular
use
as
an
English
language
idiom
after
the
publication
of
Arnold

essay

"
revival
in
architecture
In
1977
,
architectural
historian
Mark
Girouard
used
the
title
Sweetness
and
Light
:
The
"
Queen
Anne
"
Movement
,
1860
–
1900
,
for
his
book
chronicling
the
comfortably
eclectic
architectural
style
of
the
middle
-
class
brick
country
houses
that
late
-
nineteenth
-
century
British
artists
and
writers
built
for
themselves
.
Here
"
sweetness
and
light
"
implied
that
taste
and
beauty
need
not
be
restricted
only
to
the
wealthy
aristocracy
but
could
benefit
all
classes
of
society
.
Mundane
pleasantry
During
the
20th
and
21st
centuries
,
the
phrase
"
sweetness
and
light
"
has
more
typically
been
used
,
not
in
Arnold
'
s
sense
,
but
more
mundanely
,
to
indicate
merely
a
friendly
demeanor
or
a
pleasant
situation
.
Bob
'
s
close
friends
knew
he
wasn
'
t
all
sweetness
and
light
.
is
often
used
ironically
to
denote
unexpected
or
insincere
pleasantness
.

offset
by
long
passages
of
sweetness

The
presence
of
bees
and
honey
(
What
wine
goes
well
with
honey
?
)
in
literature
is
a
testament
to
their
vital
role
in
our
environment
and
the
human
fascination
with
their
industrious
nature
.
In
poetry
,
bees
are
often
celebrated
for
their
contribution
to
the
natural
process
of
pollination
and
the
creation
of
honey
,
which
is
seen
as
a
symbol
of
sweetness
and
the
rewards
of
hard
work
.
Through
the
centuries
,
bees
have
inspired
a
wealth
of
literary
works
,
from
ancient
Greek
poems
praising
honey
as
a
symbol
of
life
to
contemporary
verses
marveling
at
the
beauty
of
the
bees
’
dance
.
Literature
has
been
enriched
by
the
metaphorical
use
of
bees
and
honey
,
often
highlighting
the
interdependence
between
humans
and
these
incredible
insects
.
Literature
has
long
reflected
the
admiration
for
bees
,
infusing
narratives
with
their
imagery
and
symbolism
.
Poets
like
Emily
Dickinson
and
Anne
Sexton
have
drawn
upon
the
complex
societal
structures
and
environmental
significance
of
bees
to
craft
works
that
resonate
with
readers
on
a
deeper
level
.
Poems
specifically
praising
the
virtues
of
bees
underscore
the
harmony
found
within
the
natural
world
.
Similarly
,
stories
woven
around
these
themes
remind
readers
of
the
necessity
to
preserve
and
respect
the
ecosystems
that
sustain
life
.
In
examining
the
literary
depictions
of
bees
and
honey
,
one
finds
a
consistent
thread
of
appreciation
for
these
tiny
creatures
'
tireless
efforts
and
the
sweetness
they
produce
.
Literary
works
delve
into
the
intricate
beauty
of
nature
and
the
interconnectedness
of
all
living
things
,
using
the
bee
as
a
focal
point
to
explore
broader
themes
.
This
reflection
provides
insight
into
the
human
condition
,
the
frailty
of
ecosystems
,
and
the
often
overlooked
,
yet
significant
,
contributions
of
bees
to
the
existence
and
continuity
of
life
on
Earth
.
The
Significance
of
Bees
in
Poetry
Bees
have
long
served
as
rich
symbols
in
poetry
,
providing
insight
into
human
societies
by
drawing
parallels
to
their
industrious
nature
and
social
structure
.
Historical
Perspectives
on
Bee
Imagery
In
the
realm
of
ancient
literature
,
bees
have
been
prominent
symbols
,
indicative
of
a
range
of
human
concerns
from
diligence
to
wisdom
.
Greek
and
Roman
texts
are
abundant
with
references
to
bees
.
In
Greek
literature
,
particularly
in
the
Homeric
poems
,
bees
are
alluded
to
within
the
context
of
myths
and
traditions
,
underscoring
the
significance
of
beekeeping
in
ancient
economies
.
Roman
poetry
often
mirrored
this
fascination
,
with
poets
like
Virgil
highlighting
bees
within
their
work
to
emphasize
order
and
discipline
.
This
historical
connection
persisted
into
Chinese
literature
as
well
,
with
philosophers
like
Plato
drawing
on
the
industrious
image
of
the
bee
to
illustrate
points
about
organization
within
society
.
The
bee
'
s
tireless
work
in
pollination
and
honey
production
provided
a
model
for
human
productivity
and
creativity
.
Analyzing
the
Bee
Metaphor
in
Literature
The
metaphor
of
the
bee
in
literature
extends
beyond
historical
texts
to
envelop
a
broader
spectrum
of
meanings
.
*
Cooperation
and
Unity
:
Poets
use
the
bee
as
a
motif
to
emphasize
the
strength
found
in
collective
effort
and
the
outcomes
of
collaboration
.
*
Industry
and
Ethic
:
The
comparison
between
a
poet
'
s
diligence
in
crafting
verses
and
the
bee
'
s
dedication
in
honey
production
is
a
common
thread
in
poetry
.
This
parallel
serves
as
a
celebration
of
hard
work
and
its
sweet
rewards
,
akin
to
the
production
of
honey
.
By
invoking
the
image
of
the
honey
bee
,
writers
infuse
their
poetry
with
layers
of
significance
that
resonate
with
readers
across
different
eras
,
often
bridging
the
gap
between
nature
and
human
endeavor
.
Emily
Dickinson
'
s
Fascination
with
Bees
Emily
Dickinson
'
s
poetry
often
reflects
her
deep
admiration
for
the
natural
world
.
Among
the
various
elements
of
nature
,
bees
held
a
special
significance
in
her
work
.
She
attributed
several
human
-
like
qualities
to
these
insects
,
using
them
as
symbols
to
explore
themes
ranging
from
industriousness
to
love
.
In
Dickinson
'
s
poetry
,
bees
are
represented
as
diligent
workers
.
With
metaphorical
boots
—
"
His
feet
are
shod
with
gauze
"
—
and
gold
helmets
,
she
personifies
bees
in
a
way
that
elevates
their
natural
role
.
The
bee
'
s
labor
,
becoming
a
chant
,
and
idleness
,
a
tune
,
suggests
a
harmonious
connection
between
work
and
leisure
.
Her
poetry
intertwines
bees
with
the
theme
of
love
.
Reflecting
the
fervent
yet
delicate
nature
of
love
,
Dickinson
writes
of
a
bee
'
s
"
sweet
assault
"
on
flowers
,
a
metaphor
for
the
consuming
yet
gentle
force
of
amorous
affections
.
Dickinson
wrote
around
100
poems
that
include
bees
,
and
the
creatures
embody
the
eloquence
and
vitality
of
nature
.
She
saw
in
them
not
just
biological
entities
but
messengers
that
unraveled
the
mysteries
of
the
world
,
of
love
,
and
of
existence
.
Nature
served
as
an
indispensable
source
of
inspiration
for
Dickinson
.
Bees
,
through
their
interplay
with
flowers
,
exemplify
the

Interconnectedness
in
Bee
-
Inspired
Themes
The
literary
fascination
with
bees
often
centers
on
their
societal
structures
and
collective
behaviors
which
reflect
the
human
notions
of
community
and
interconnectedness
.
Community
and
Collaboration
Bees
symbolize
a
well
-
organized
society
where
every
individual
plays
a
specific
role
for
the
greater
good
of
the
community
.
This
is
exemplified
in
The
Bees
:
Poems
by
Carol
Ann
Duffy
,
where
the
hive
represents
a
complex
society
with
shared
responsibilities
.
Labor
and
industriousness
are
key
traits
in
bee
communities
and
are
often
paralleled
with
human
collaboration
in
literary
works
.
Unity
and
Harmony
The
hive
serves
as
a
metaphor
for
unity
and
harmony
in
both
classical
literature
and
modern
analyses
.
The
swarm
moves
together
,
embodying
interconnectedness
at
its
core
.
Additionally
,
the
role
of
bees
within
our
ecosystem
has
been
explored
through
poetic
symbolism
,
indicating
how
the
survival
of
one
species
is
integrally
linked
to
the
well
-
being
of
all
others
.
The
classical
texts
showed
an
awareness
of
this
balance
,
extending
the
metaphor
to
the
stability
of
human
societies
.
Nature
'
s
Bounty
:
Honey
as
Symbolism
Honey
,
with
its
rich
symbolic
history
,
often
represents
the
sweetness
of
life
and
the
pleasures
that
come
with
it
.
This
symbolism
has
made
honey
a
substantial
subject
in
literature
,
offering
depth
and
complexity
to
poetic
expressions
.
Honey
in
Romantic
Poetry
Emily
Dickinson
,
a
revered
figure
in
the
pantheon
of
American
poets
,
frequently
infused
the
concept
of
honey
with
broader
themes
of
joy
and
the
fleeting
nature
of
bliss
.
In
her
poems
,
honey
represents
not
just
the
literal
nectar
but
also
the
essence
of
life
'
s
exquisite
moments
.
For
Dickinson
,
the
sensory
experience
of
honey
'
s
sweetness
serves
as
a
metaphor
for
the
intensity
and
pleasure
found
in
life
’
s
simplest
experiences
.
Conversely
,
John
Keats
,
a
Romantic
poet
known
for
his
rich
imagery
and
sensual
language
,
used
honey
as
a
symbol
to
convey
a
passionate
appreciation
of
beauty
and
sensory
delights
.
In
"
Ode
to
a
Nightingale
,
"
Keats
references
tasting
the
"
purple
-
stained
mouth
"
of
wine
,
metaphorically
linking
the
nectar
of
the
gods
with
life
'
s
ephemeral
pleasures
.
Honey
,
within
the
context
of
Keats
’
poetry
,
is
akin
to
a
divine
substance
,
promising
joy
and
an
escape
from
the
sorrows
of
the
world
.
The
Sweetness
of
Life
and
its
Pleasures
The
literary
symbol
of
honey
extends
beyond
mere
alimentary
pleasure
;
it
encompasses
the
spectrum
of
life
'
s
simple
joys
.
The
symbolism
doesn
'
t
simply
point
to
physical
satisfaction
but
also
represents
spiritual
nourishment
and
the
contentment
found
in
harmonious
living
with
nature
.
Honey
'
s
sweetness
is
often
juxtaposed
with
the
laborious
effort
of
bees
,
reminding
readers
of
the
rewards
that
come
from
diligence
and
harmonious
work
within
the
community
.
It
'
s
a
reminder
of
the
balance
between
effort
and
enjoyment
,
encouraging
an
appreciation
for
the
sweetness
that
life
provides
after
periods
of
toil
.
The
Role
of
Flowers
in
Bee
-
Themed
Literature
Flowers
in
bee
-
themed
literature
often
symbolize
the
interconnectedness
of
nature
,
reflecting
themes
of
mutualism
and
aesthetic
beauty
.
They
are
central
in
depicting
the
symbiotic
relationship
between
bees
and
their
environment
.
The
Flower
and
Bee
Dance
In
bee
-
themed
literature
,
the
"
dance
"
between
bees
and
flowers
is
not
just
a
physical
interaction
for
pollination
but
also
a
literary
motif
that
illustrates
nature
'
s
rhythms
.
The
flower
acts
as
a
beacon
,
with
its
vibrant
petals
and
inviting
nectar
.
Blossoms
serve
as
a
stage
for
the
bee
'
s
diligent
foraging
,
and
this
dance
is
often
used
to
symbolize
harmony
in
the
natural
world
.
Authors
use
this
imagery
to
emphasize
the
delicate
balance
of
ecosystems
.

The
interplay
between
bees
and
flowers
is
a
key
theme
in
seasonal
poetry
,
especially
when
describing
the
vibrancy
of
summer
when
nature
is
at
its
peak
of
productivity
.
Representations
of
Growth
and
Beauty
Flowers
in
literature
are
not
only
fonts
of
nectar
for
bees
but
also
embodiments
of
growth
and
beauty
.
They
often
represent
life
'
s
flourishing
under
the
nurturing
sun
of
summer
and
within
the
rich
biodiversity
of
the
meadow
.
Their
bloom
from
buds
into
full
blossomed
beauty
is
a
common
metaphor
for
character
development
or
the
blossoming
of
ideas
and
emotions
.
*
Nectar
:
A
metaphor
for
the
rewards
of
hard

and
diligence
.
*
Nature
:
The
overarching
setting
that
houses
both
the
flowers
and
the
bees
.
*
Beauty
:
Often
substantiated
in
the
literature
by
the
visual
harmony
of
flowers
and
bees
coexisting
.
Through
this
lens
,
flowers
convey
a
message
of
potential
,
the
innate
promise
within
all
living
things
to
manifest
their
intrinsic
beauty
,
paralleling
the
bees
'
journey
from
flower
to
flower
as
an
emblematic
quest
for
fulfillment
.
Bees
and
the
Art
of
Hard
Work
Bees
have
long
served
as
a
symbol
of
hard
work
and
productivity
.
Their
tireless
efforts
in
pollen
collection
and
honey
production
have
made
them
a
common
motif
in
literature
,
especially
within
poetry
that
praises
the
virtues
of
labor
and
the
rewards
of
diligence
.
The
Industrious
Bee
Honey
bees
are
often
portrayed
as
the
embodiment
of
industriousness
.
Writers
draw
parallels
between
the
bees
'
unceasing
movement
and
the
importance
of
persistent
effort
in
achieving
success
.
In
this
regard
,
bees
do
not
just
represent
sheer
labor
;
they
stand
for
intelligent
and
organized
work
that
contributes
to
the
greater
good
of
their
hive
.
They
are
described
as
workers
who
cooperate
,
each
fulfilling
their
role
with
precision
and
dedication
,
ensuring
the
survival
and
prosperity
of
their
community
.
Labor
and
Harvest
in
Poetry
Poetry
captures
the
dual
aspect
of
labor
and
harvest
with
regard
to
bees
.
The
process
from
the
tireless
gathering
of
nectar
to
the
creation
of
honey
is
celebrated
and
seen
as
a
metaphor
for
the
creative
process
itself
.
Poets
liken
their
artistic
endeavors
to
the
bees
'
production
of
honey
,
suggesting
that
like
the
bees
,
their
hard
work
leads
to
the
sweet
reward
of
accomplished
art
.
The
consistent
labor
of
the
bee
,
with
its
inevitable
result
of
precious
honey
,
mirrors
the
poet
'
s
hope
that
from
the
rigors
of
composition
comes
a
work
of
beauty
and
lasting
value
.
Symbolic
Overtones
of
the
Hive
Structure
The
hive
in
literature
often
emerges
as
a
complex
symbol
,
embodying
themes
of
community
,
structure
,
and
governance
.
Each
component
of
the
hive
'
s
societal
architecture
,
from
the
busy
workers
to
the
overarching
presence
of
the
queen
,
is
loaded
with
significance
that
authors
and
poets
have
mined
for
centuries
.
Community
:
The
beehive
represents
a
tightly
-
knit
community
where
each
member
has
a
specific
role
.
Literature
often
draws
parallels
between
human
society
and
the
colony
,
highlighting
the
importance
of
unity
and
collective
effort
.
*
Queen
:
The
queen
bee
is
not
merely
an
inhabitant
of
the
hive
but
its
core
.
She
asserts
a
subtle
but
pervasive
influence
over
the
colony
,
much
like
monarchs
in
classic
literature
whose
reigns
create
the
terrain
for
tales
of
power
,
legacy
,
and
continuity
.
Structure
:
The
precise
,
geometric
structure
of
the
honeycomb
has
been
a
source
of
fascination
,
symbolizing
the
marvels
of
natural
engineering
and
often
representing
the
idea
of
a
well
-
organized
society
.
*

Literary
works
have
explored
the
dynamics
within
a
bee
colony
,
noting
the
specialization
and
hierarchy
that
enable
a
thriving
,
efficient
community
.
Taxation
:
Just
as
bees
collect
pollen
and
nectar
,
which
they
transform
into
honey
,
a
parallel
can
be
drawn
with
the
concept
of
tax
in
human
societies
—
the
collection
and
redistribution
of
resources
that
is
often
subject
to
scrutiny
and
reform
in
literature
.
In
emblematic
representation
,
the
hive
is
not
just
a
home
for
bees
but
a
mirror
reflecting
the
intricacies
of
civilizations
,
complete
with
laws
,
duties
,
and
social
stratification
,
prompting
readers
to
consider
the
foundations
and
functionality
of
their
own
communal
structures
.

The
Role
of
the
Bee
in
Nurturing
Life
Bees
are
often
portrayed
as
agents
of
vitality

a
process
that
is
essential
for
plant
reproduction
.
Writers
use
this
imagery
to
reflect
on
themes
of
fertility
and
the
continuation
of
life
.
In

Cultural
Depictions
of
Bees
Across
Civilizations
The
bee
has
been
a
symbol
of
community
,
diligence
,
and
sweetness
throughout
various
civilizations
in
history
.
Its
influence
spans
from
ancient
myths
to
modern
literary
works
,
reflecting
the
enduring
presence
of
bees
in
human
culture
.
Bees
in
Ancient
Myths
and
Fables
Greek
and
Roman
Literature
:
In
Greek
and
Roman
times
,
bees
were
often
portrayed
as
models
of
society
due
to
their
structured
hives
and
industrious
nature
.
Philosophers
like
Aristotle
wrote
extensively
about
bees
in
his
Historia
Animalium
,
where
he
observed
their
behavior
and
social
structure
.
India
:
The
bee
also
features
in
ancient
Indian
scriptures
and
poetry
,
symbolizing
love
and
romantic
emotions
.
It
appears
in
the
Rigveda
,
one
of
the
oldest
sacred
texts
,
emphasizing
the
connection
between
bees
,
nature
,
and
spirituality
.
Modern
Interpretations
and
Inspirations
Continued
Symbolism
:
Modern
literature
continues
to
utilize
the
bee
as
a
symbol
.
Poets
and
authors
often
reference
bees
to
represent
both
personal
and
societal
qualities
,
such
as
perseverance
,
harmony
,
and
interconnectivity
.
Cultural
Significance
:
The
bee
’
s
role
transcends
just
literary
symbolism
;
it
also
serves
as
a
key
cultural
icon
.
In
contemporary
stories
and
poems
,
bees
inspire
themes
of
environmental
concern
,
echoing
their
critical
role
in
natural
ecosystems
.
Historically
and
culturally
,
bees
are
depicted
not
only
as
vital
contributors
to
the
environment
but
also
as
inspirations
for
values
and
lessons
in
countless
narratives
.
Exploring
the
Sonic
Elements
of
Bees
Bees
'
communication
methods
are
complex
,
relying
on
sound
and
movement
as
well
as
chemical
signals
to
interact
with
their
hive
and
environment
.
The
Hum
and
Dance
of
Bees
Bee
Hum
:
The
sound
bees
produce
,
often
referred
to
as
buzzing
,
results
from
their
wings
beating
at
a
high
frequency
.
This
hum
is
not
only
a
byproduct
of
flight
but
also
a
means
of
communication
.
Worker
bees
generate
a
distinct
humming
vibration
to
signal
others
when
the
hive
needs
to
swarm
or
relocate
.
Bee
Dance
:
Another
sophisticated
form
of
bee
communication
is
the
"
dance
"
they
perform
.
There
are
two
primary
types
of
dances
:
the
round
dance
and
the
waggle
dance
.
Bees
use
the
round
dance
to
indicate
the
presence
of
food
near
the
hive
.
The
waggle
dance
,
which
involves
a
figure
-
eight
pattern
with
variations
in
duration
and
vigor
,
communicates
more
specific
information
such
as
the
distance
and
direction
of
food
sources
relative
to
the
sun
.
This
dance
also
informs
fellow
bees
about
the
quality
of
pollen
or
nectar
,
which
might
include
bee
bread
,
a
mixture
of
pollen
and
honey
essential
for
the
colony
'
s
nourishment
.

Pheromones
and
Communication
Bees
utilize
a
complex
system
of
chemical
signals
or
pheromones
to
convey
important
messages
throughout
the
hive
.
The
queen
bee
,
for
example
,
releases
a
royal
jelly
-
related
pheromone
that
regulates
the
hive
'
s
activities
,
inhibits
the
development
of
new
queens
,
and
ensures
her
unique
status
within
the
colony
.
Pheromones
play
a
critical
role
in
hive
defense
and
health
,
communicating
alarm
or
gathering
bees
to
defend
the
hive
from
intruders
.
Additionally
,
worker
bees
use
pheromones
to
guide
others
to
sources
of
resinous
tree
sap
,
which
they
convert
into
propolis
.
This
substance
acts
as
a
hive
sealant
,
providing
structural
stability
and
protecting
against
pathogens
.
*
Alarm
Pheromone
:
This
alerts
bees
of
potential
threats
and
coordinates
a
defense
response
.
*
Foraging
Pheromone
:
It
assists
in
directing
bees
to
profitable
food
sources
and
can
be
found
in
bee
bread
.
*
Health
-
Related
Pheromones
:
Diseases
within
the
hive
can
often
be
communicated
through
changes
in
pheromone
patterns
.
These
changes
can
lead
to
increased
production
of
propolis
to
combat
the
threat
.
The
interplay
between
these
sonic
elements
and
chemical
signals
showcases
the
richness
of
bee
communication
and
exemplifies
the
natural
world
'
s
intricacies
.
Contemporary
Bee
Poetry

Prose
Contemporary
literature
often
reflects
the
growing
concerns
over
bee
conservation

environmental
urgency
.

populations
*
Perspective
:
Investigative
and
revealing
Literature
addresses
not
only
bees
but
extends
to
animal
poems
,
bird
poems
,
and
butterfly
poems
,
each
contributing
to
the
broader
conversation
on
the
environment
and
conservation
.
Poets
and
writers
use
the
motif
of
these
creatures
to
underscore
the
biodiversity
crisis
and
the
urgency
of
conservation
efforts
.
*
Example
:
The
collection
titled
The
Threshold
,
engages
readers
with
narratives
about
the
delicate
balance
between
nature
and
human
impact
.
*
Imagery
:
Often
employs
vivid
descriptions
of
the
natural
world
to
draw
readers
'
attention
to
environmental
issues
.
By
celebrating
bees
and
addressing
the
perils
they
face
,
contemporary
bee
poetry
and
prose
serve
as
a
crucial
reminder
of
our
shared
responsibility
to
the
environment
.
The
literary
world
continues
to
contribute
to
this
dialogue
,
urging
both
awareness
and
action
.
Poetic
Devices
and
Styles
in
Bee
Literature
The
depiction
of
bees
in
literature
often
employs
a
variety
of
poetic
devices
and
styles
,
notably
metaphor
and
simile
,
as
well
as
distinctive
rhythm
and
rhyme
schemes
.
These
techniques
enhance
the
literary
representation
of
bees
,
imbuing
the
texts
with
deeper
meaning
and
a
structured
aesthetic
quality
.
Use
of
Metaphor
and
Simile
In
bee
literature
,
metaphors
and
similes
are
extensively
used
to
draw
parallels
between
human
society
and
the
intricate
workings
of
bee
colonies
.
For
instance
,
a
bee
'
s
dedication
to
the
hive
frequently
stands
as
a
metaphor
for
selflessness
or
communal
labor
.
A
simile
might
compare
the
bee
'
s
tireless
foraging
to
a
diligent
worker
,
"
as
busy
as
a
bee
,
"
highlighting
a
shared
sense
of
purpose
and
dedication
.
These
comparisons
serve
not
just
as
stylistic
flourishes
but
as
tools
to
explore
complex
human
themes
through
the
simpler
,
yet
profoundly
organized
lives
of
bees
.
Rhythm
and
Rhyme
Schemes
The
rhythmic
flow
of
verses
in
bee
-
inspired
poetry
often
mimics
the
buzzing
hum
of
a
bee
'
s
flight
or
the
organized
chaos
of
a
hive
.
Writers
may
use
an
iambic
or
trochaic
meter
to
establish
a
cadence
that
resonates
with
the
natural
activities
of
bees
.
Additionally
,
rhyme
schemes
can
vary
from
the
traditional
AABB
or
ABAB
to
more
complex
patterns
,
reflecting
the
multifaceted
nature
of
bee
behavior
and
social
structure
.
The
intentional
structuring
of
rhythm
and
rhyme
can
significantly
influence
the
mood
and
tone
,
conveying
a
spectrum
of
emotions
from
the
serene
to
the
bustling
energy
found
within
bee
communities
.
The
Inner
Life
of
Bees
in
Stories
Literature
often
explores
the
complexity
of
bees
,
delving
into
their
possible
psychology
and
emotions
,
and
utilizing
anthropomorphism
to
present
bees
as
characters
with
human
-
like
qualities
.
Bee
Psychology
and
Emotions
Scholars
and
storytellers
have
long
been
fascinated
by
the
idea
that
bees
,
specifically
Apis
mellifera
,
might
possess
an
inner
life
characterized
by
emotions
.
While
the
scientific
community
debates
the
extent
to
which
bees
can
experience
feelings
,
authors
in
the
literary
world
have
ascribed
to
them
a
range
of
emotional
capacities
.
They
portray
bees
as
exhibiting
diligence
and
dedication
,
emotions
that
resonate
with
human
experience
.
The
use
of
bees
as
allegorical
figures
in
stories
underlines
a
belief
in
the
soulful
nature
of
these
insects
.
Anthropomorphism
in
Literature
Anthropomorphism
is
a
literary
device
where
animals
or
objects
are
given
human
characteristics
,
and
it
is
extensively
applied
to
bees
in
stories
.
This
technique
allows
authors
to
explore
and
reflect
on
human
society
,
relationships
,
and
individual
roles
through
the
lens
of
the
bee
’
s
complex
social
structure
.
By
endowing
bees
with
human
attributes
,
the
literature
adds
depth
to
the
characters
of
bees
,
enriching
the
narrative
and
engaging
readers
in
a
reflection
of
their
own
inner
lives
.
Influential
Bee
Poets
and
Authors
Throughout
literary
history
,
bees
have
inspired
authors
and
poets
with
their
diligence
and
communal
living
,
resulting
in
a
rich
tapestry
of
works
.
This
section
showcases
two
renowned
figures
whose
writings
on
bees
have
shaped
the
literary
landscape
.
Sylvia
Plath
'
s
Bee
Sequence
Sylvia
Plath
is
celebrated
for
her
formidable
"
Bee
Sequence
"
poems
,
which
stand
out
in
her
oeuvre
for
their
allegorical
depth
and
technical
prowess
.
In
works
such
as
"
The
Bee
Meeting
,
"
"
The
Arrival
of
the
Bee
Box
,
"
"
Stings
,
"
"
The
Swarm
,
"
and
"
Wintering
,
"
she
draws
compelling
parallels
between
the
social
dynamics
of
beehives
and
human
experience
.
These
poems
reflect
her
personal
struggles
and
exhibit
her
profound
engagement
with
this
natural
motif
.
John
Keats
and
the
Odes
of
Nature
John
Keats
'
s
poetic
engagement
with
nature
often
includes
the
humble
bee
.
His
ode
"
To
Autumn
,
"
for
instance
,
is
imbued
with
images
of
bees
,
reflecting
both
an
appreciation
of
the
natural
world
'
s
cycles
and
a
deeper
meditation
on
creativity
and
life
.
Keats
'
s
ability
to
infuse
small
details
with
great
significance
has
made
his
writing
a
point
of
reference
for
those
looking
to
explore
the
interconnectedness
of
creatures
and
the
environment
in
literature
.
Conclusion
Bees
and
honey
have
long
been
a
source
of
inspiration
in
literature
.
The
diligence
of
bees
is
often
mirrored
in
the
meticulous
practice
of
writing
itself
.
Honey
symbolizes
nature
'
s
bounty
,
while
bees
represent
the
tireless
labor
behind
its
production
.
Through
poetry
,
authors
pay
homage
to
these
tireless
workers
,
often
drawing
parallels
between
the
beehive
'
s
community
and
human
society
.
The
theme
of
interconnectedness
is
common
,
emphasizing
how
every
living
thing
contributes
to
a
larger
ecosystem
.
In
literature
,
bees
often
symbolize
collectivism
,
spotlighting
the
importance
of
each
individual
in
maintaining
the
balance
of
the
environment
.
The
preservation
of
nature
,
mirroring
the
protection
of
cultural
and
literary
heritage
,
is
a
recurrent
motif
.
Writers
employ
these
motifs
to
invoke
reflection
on
the
human
experience
,
paralleling
the
complexity
and
the
beauty
of
natural
processes
.
In
essence
,
the
literary
voyages
into
the
world
of
bees
and
honey
foster
a
greater
appreciation
for
the
seemingly
mundane
aspects
of
life
,
urging
readers
to
recognize
the
underlying
interconnectedness
and
mutual
dependence
.

Arguments
against
soft
determinism
Soft
determinism
,
also
known
as
compatibilism
,
is
the
belief
that
determinism
is
compatible
with
free
will
and
moral
responsibility
.
In
other
words
,
soft
determinism
states
that
even
though
all
events
in
the
world
are
predetermined
by
what
came
before
them
,
it
is
still
possible
for
people
to
have
free
will
and
thus
be
morally
responsible
for
their
actions
.
Soft
determinism
is
one
branch
of
determinism
.
Determinism
is
the
idea
that
everything
that
happens
could
not
have
gone
otherwise
;
each
event
has
a
fixed
outcome
because
of
everything
that
led
to
it
.
American
psychologist
and
philosopher
William
James
first
used
the
term
soft
determinism
in
his
essay
“
The
Dilemma
of
Determinism
”
(
James
,
1895
)
.
Soft
determinism
is
a
branch
of
determinism
that
differs
from
hard
determinism
.
These
branches
differ
in
their
views
on
whether
free
will
is
possible
in
a
deterministic
universe
.
Soft
determinists
believe
that
free
will
is
possible
in
a
deterministic
universe
,
even
when
everything
is
predetermined
.
They
believe
that
as
long
as
no
external
forces
force
someone
to
make
a
certain
choice
,
the
person
has
made
a
free
choice
.

Hard
determinism

incompatibilism
:
The
philosophy
that
determinism

to
have

responsibility
for
one
’
s
actions
.
Examples
of
soft
determinism
Nagel
’
s
example
of
the
peach
or
the
cake
To
explain
the
idea
of
determinism
,
philosopher
Thomas
Nagel
(
1987
)
uses
an
example
of
choosing
between
selecting
a
peach
or
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
out
of
a
cafeteria
line
.
If
you
choose
the
cake
and
think
to
yourself
,
“
I
could
have
chosen
the
peach
instead
,
”
what
does
that
mean
,
and
is
it
true
?
A
soft
determinist
would
say
that
because
of
some
combination
of
your
genetics
,
your
life
experiences
,
your
environmental
surroundings
,
and
other
factors
,
the
fact
that
you
chose
the
cake
was
inevitable
.
The
process
of
you
deciding
to
choose
the
cake
was
just
the
follow
-
through
of
a
predetermined
conclusion
.
It
is
not
possible
that
you
could
have
chosen
the
peach
instead
of
the
cake
.
However
,
you
still
acted
with
free
will
because
there
was
no
external
force
compelling
you
to
choose
the
cake
and
not
the
peach
;
no
one
was
constraining
you
or
forcing
you
,
and
therefore
you
made
the
choice
freely
.
Another
example
:
To
study
or
to
party
?
Imagine
a
Friday
night
where
you
have
a
choice
to
stay
home
and
study
for
a
big
exam
on
Monday
,
or
to
go
to
a
party
with
friends
,
and
you
end
up
choosing
to
stay
home
and
study
.
A
soft
determinist
would
say
that
this
choice
was
predetermined
;
you
were
always
destined
to
choose
to
study
because
of
some
combination
of
your
genetics
,
how
your
parents
raised
you
to
value
education
,
your
knowledge
that
the
exam
is
very
important
,
and
your
desire
to
get
a
good
grade
,
and
so
on
.
However
,
even
though
your
choice
to
study
was
inevitable
,
you
still
acted
with
free
will
because
your
choice
was
in
line
with
your
desires
and
motivations
.
Arguments
in
favor
of
soft
determinism
Soft
determinism
relies
on
a
certain
definition
of
the
concept
of
“
freedom
.
”
It
argues
the
natural
meaning
of
“
freedom
”
is
lack
of
restraint
or
compulsion
.
Soft
determinists
argue
that
when
people
think
about
“
free
will
,
”
they
are
referring
to
physical
and
psychological
freedom
from
being
forced
to
act
or
constrained
into
not
acting
a
certain
way
.
They
argue
that
this
definition
of
“
freedom
”
is
most
intuitive
.
Soft
determinists
argue
that
given
this
intuitive
definition
of
freedom
,
free
will
is
possible
under
determinism
because
the
only
necessary
condition
for
free
will
is
that
someone
is
free
from
restraint
and
compulsion
.
Even
if
all
of
someone
’
s
personality
,
desires
,
and
motivation
may
be
predetermined
by
nature
and
nurture
,
they
can
still
have
free
will
and
make
free
choices
within
how
they
are
predisposed
to
act
or
think
.
One
philosopher
who
argued
in
favor
of
soft
determinism
was
Harry
Frankfurt
.
Frankfurt
(
1971
)
argued
that
people
have
free
will
when
they
have
a
certain
psychological
structure
;
namely
,
when
their
first
-
order
desires
align
with
their
second
-
order
desires
.
Frankfurt
defines
first
-
order
desire
as
“
what
you
want
,
”
and
second
-
order
desire
as
“
what
you
want
to
want
.
”
Someone
has
free
will
if
what
they
want
aligns
with
what
they
want
to
want
.
For
instance
,
if
your
first
-
order
desire
is
to
go
for
a
walk
,
and
your
second
-
order
desire
is
to
want
to
walk
,
then
your
first
and
second
-
order
desires
align
,
and
you
are
free
.
This
is
how
it
is
possible
to
be
free
under
determinism
:
Even
though
your
first
and
second
-
order
desires
may
be
pre
-
determined
,
you
are
free
since
they
align
with
each
other
.
Arguments
against
soft
determinism
Critics
of
soft
determinism
generally
fall
into
two
categories
:
those
who
disagree
that
determinism
is
true
at
all
,
and
those
who
agree
that
determinism
is
true
,
but
disagree
with
compatibilism
and
argue
that
determinism
is
incompatible
with
free
will
and
moral
responsibility
(
Strawson
,
n
.
d
.
)
.
Critics
of
soft
determinism
who
instead
believe
in
hard
determinism
argue
that
the
former
does
not
encompass
a
complete
understanding
of
the
nature
of
determinism
and
free
will
.
They
believe
that
under
determinism
,
it
is
impossible
to
have
free
will
or
be
morally
responsible
for
one
’
s
actions
.
Hard
determinists
believe
that
the
soft
determinist
definition
of
free
will
is
not
sufficient
.
They
believe
that
the
soft
determinist
definition
of
freedom
is
contrived
and
does
not
get
to
the
true
meaning
of
freedom
.
Kant
referred
to
soft
determinism
as
a
“
wretched
subterfuge
…
,
a
petty
word
-
juggerly
.
”
These
hard
determinists
believe
that
if
all
of
a
person
’
s
thoughts
,
desires
,
and
choices
are
predetermined
by
factors
often
out
of
their
control
,
then
it
is
impossible
to
be
truly
free
or
morally
responsible
for
their
actions
.
Besides
the
hard
determinism
,
there
are
two
additional
major
schools
of
thought
that
disagree
with
soft
determinism
:
libertarianism
,
and
pessimism
.
The
libertarianists
believe
that
we
have
free
will
,
but
this
is
incompatible
with
determinism
,
so
determinism
must
not
be
true
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
pessimists
,
or
no
-
freedom
theorists
,
believe
that
free
will
is
impossible
,
whether
or
not
determinism
is
true
.
Psychological
research
on
people
’
s
beliefs
about
free
will
Several
researchers
have
investigated
the
psychology
behind
people
’
s
beliefs
about
determinism
,
free
will
,
and
moral
responsibility
.
Nichols
and
Knobe
(
2007
)
investigated
how
the
phrasing
of
questions
about
these
issues
affects
people
’
s
responses
.
They
found
that
when
they
asked
people
questions
about
the
consequences
of
determinism
in
an
abstract
sense
,
people
’
s
answers
aligned
with
hard
determinism
.
For
example
,
if
asked
,
“
If
everything
in
the
world
was
predetermined
,
would
it
be
possible
to
have
free
will
?
”
participants
often
said
it
wouldn
’
t
be
possible
.
However
,
when
you
asked
people
specific
,
emotionally
-
triggering
questions
about
the
consequences
of
determinism
,
their
answers
became
more
aligned
with
soft
determinism
.
Nahmias
(
2011
)
shows
that
hard
determinism
is
unintuitive
for
average
people
.
The
author
argues
that
this
evidence
provides
support
in
the
direction
of
soft
determinism
.
The
author
also
provides
evidence
that
when
you
talk
to
average
people
about
determinism
,
they
often
confuse
it
with
bypassing
,
a
distinct
psychological
phenomenon
in
which
our
minds
have
no
say
in
our
bodies
’
choices
.

Soft
matter
or
soft
condensed
matter
is
a
type
of
matter
that
can
be
deformed
or
structurally
altered
by
thermal
or
mechanical
stress
which
is
of
similar
magnitude
to
thermal
fluctuations
.
The
science
of
soft

is

and
a

The

across

was
key
to
understanding
its
universality
,

not
based

or

.
Interesting
behaviors
arise
from
soft
matter
in
ways
that
cannot
be
predicted
,
or
are
difficult
to
predict
,
directly
from
its
atomic
or
molecular
constituents
.
Materials
termed
soft
matter
exhibit
this
property
due
to
a
shared
propensity
of
these
materials
to
self
-
organize
into
mesoscopic
physical
structures
.
The
assembly
of
the
mesoscale
structures
that
form
the
macroscale
material
is
governed
by
low
energies
,
and
these
low
energy
associations
allow
for
the
thermal
and
hard
condensed
matter
physics
it
is
often
possible
to
predict
the
overall
behavior
of
a
material
because
the
molecules
are
organized
into
a
crystalline
lattice
with
no
changes
in
the
pattern
at
any
mesoscopic
scale
.
Unlike
hard
materials
,
where
only
small
distortions
occur
from
thermal
or
mechanical
agitation
,
soft
matter
can
undergo
local
A
defining
characteristic
of
soft
matter
is
the
mesoscopic
scale
of
physical
structures
.
The
structures
are
much
larger
than
the
microscopic
scale
(
the
arrangement
of
atoms
and
molecules
)
,
and
yet
are
much
smaller
than
the
macroscopic
(
overall
)
scale
of
the
material
.
The
properties
and
interactions
of
these
mesoscopic
structures
may
number
of
constituents
forming
these
mesoscopic
structures
,
and
the
large
degrees
of
freedom
this
causes
,
results
in
a
general
disorder
between
the
large
-
scale
structures
.
This
disorder
leads
to
the
loss
of
For
example
,
the
turbulent
vortices
that
naturally
occur
within
a
flowing
liquid
are
much
smaller
than
the
overall
quantity
of
liquid
and
yet
much
larger
than
its
individual
molecules
,
and
the
emergence
of
these
vortices
controls
the
overall
flowing
behavior
of
the
material
.
Also
,
the
bubbles
that
compose
a
foam
are
mesoscopic
because
they
individually
consist
of
a
vast
number
of
molecules
,
and
yet
the
foam
itself
consists
of
a
great
number
of
these
bubbles
,
and
the
overall
mechanical
stiffness
of
the
foam
emerges
from
the
combined
interactions
of
the
bubbles
.
Typical
bond
energies
in
soft
matter
structures
are
of
similar
scale
to
thermal
energies
.
Therefore
the
structures
are
constantly
affected
by
deformation

Applications
Soft
materials
are
important
in
a
wide
range
of
technological
applications
,
and
each
soft
material
can
often
be
associated
with
multiple
disciplines
.
Liquid
crystals
,
for
example
,
were
originally
discovered
in
the
biological
sciences
when
the
botanist
and
chemist
liquid
crystals
have
also
found
applications
as
liquid

,
liquid

tunable
filters
,
and
liquid

.
Active

are
another
example
of
soft

have
found
diverse
applications
,
from
the
natural
rubber
found
in

to
the
vulcanized

found
in

.
Polymers
encompass
a
large
range
of
soft
matter
,
with
applications
in
material
science
.
An
example
of
this
is
hydrogel
.
With
the
ability
to
undergo

,
hydrogels
are
well
suited
for
the
development

Polymers
also
encompass
biological

such
as

,
where
research
insights
from
soft

research
have
been
applied
to

naturally
occur
,
such
as
the
head
on
a

,
or
be

intentionally
,
such
as

.
The
physical
properties
available
to
foams
have
resulted
in
applications
which
can
be
based
on
foams
being
used
as

,
and

the
problems
considered
in

days
of

science
were
those
pertaining

.
As
such
,
an
important
application
of

research
is

Artist
Lora
Mathis
was
the
first
to
spell
it
out
for
me
:
radical
softness
can
be
used
as
a
weapon
.
Their
well
-
known
piece
,
“
Radical
Softness
as
a
Weapon
”
showed
these
words
surrounded
by
pearls
,
diamond
earrings
,
and
knives
.
Though
the
piece
began
making
the
rounds
on
the
internet
a
few
years
ago
,
the
interest
in
softness
has
continued
to
circulate
,
and
show
up
in
sometimes
unexpected
places
.
By
softness
I
mean
a
general
orientation
to
the
world
that
foregrounds
vulnerability
,
emotionality
,
and
earnestness
.
This
stands
in
contrast
to
hardness
,
an
approach
that
often
relies
on
irony
and
sarcasm
to
shore
up
the
image
of
infallible
impenetrability
.
Hardness
wants
to
appear
unattached
and
unaffected
.
Hardness
wants
to
believe
it
can
pull
itself
up
by
the
bootstraps
.
Hardness
wants
us
to
see
this
as
strength
.
The
preference
for
hardness
that
prevails
in
many
circles
betrays
a
hefty
stake
in
the
(
neo
)
liberal
myth
of
the
autonomous
,
independent
subject
.
But
many
argue
that
acknowledging
our
vulnerability
foregrounds
our
actual
interdependent
human
nature
,
rather
than
pretending
we
could
live
without
each
other
.
The
shift
to
softness
is
multi
-
pronged
;
it
can
be
charted
through
pop
music
(
from
Katy
Perry
’
s
2010
-
era
party
pop
to
Ariana
Grande
’
s
earnest
“
thank
u
”
to
her
ex
-
boyfriends
)
,
graphic
design
(
Pantone
’
s
dubbing
“
rose
quartz
”
and
“
serenity
”
the
colours
of
the
year
in
2016
)
,
public
campaigns
about
mental
health
(
like
Bell
’
s
(
in
)
famous
“
Let
’
s
Talk
”
)
,
and
advertising
(
like
Wonder
Bread
’
s
newest
slogan
,
“
The
Power
of
Softness
”
)
.
But
it
is
in
queer
,
feminist
politics
that
softness
seems
to
be
rooted
.
Actually
,
because
it
stands
in
opposition
to
(
neo
)
liberal
norms
of
rationality
and
independence
,
softness
is
an
inherently
queer
,
feminist
stance
.
In
recent
years
,
there
has
been
feminist
backlash
against
the
notion
of
being
“
chill
,
”
what
author
and
activist
Virgie
Tovar
describes
as
“
an
environment
where
low
expectations
,
low
commitment
,
and
zero
accountability
are
considered
normal
and
,
in
fact
,
laudable
.
”
Writer
Emma
Pitman
considers
the
attribute
,
“
chill
,
”
a
paltry
prize
for
a
woman
’
s
“
perceived
indifference
,
complicity
,
and
disinterest
in
holding
“
‘
chill
’
actually
sucks
,
”
Pitman
opts
for
the
alternative
:
earnestness
,
the
only
way
she
sees
to
cut
through
“
Ironic
Sexism
.
”
“
Instead
of
valorising
earnestness
in
the
abstract
,
I
’
ll
get
literal
and
make
the
vulnerable
,
uncool
admission
that
ironic
sexism
hurts
me
,
”
she
writes
,
indeed
shattering
the
image
of
impenetrability
.
Feminist
writer
Jessica
Valenti
,
too
,
seems
to
be
tired
of
laughing
it
off
.
In
her
memoir
Sex
Object
,
Valenti
claims
,
“
The
feminism
that
’
s
popular
right
now
is
largely
grounded
in
using
optimism
and
humour
to
ourselves
a
disservice
by
working
so
hard
to
move
past
what
sexism
has
done
to
us
rather
than
observe
it
for
a
while
.
”
For
these
writers
,
being
earnest
means
honouring
pain
—
especially
that
instilled
by
sexism
and
patriarchy
—
and
doing
so
is
a
way
to
construct
protective
boundaries
that
work
better
than
irony
and
humour
ever
could
.
Irony
offers
no
way
to
appeal
to
each
other
’
s
humanity
;
humour
doesn
’
t
ask
someone
to
be
accountable
for
their
actions
.
Both
are
indirect
,
and
at
best
simply
offer
commentary
on
the
current
situation
rather
than
demand
its
interruption
.
In
contrast
,
softness
means
admitting
,
“
you
hurt
me
,
”
but
also
,
“
I
deserve
better
.
”
Meanwhile
,
posts
about
tenderqueers
and
soft
femmes
have
been
circulating
on
Tumblr
since
at
least
2012
,
indicating
a
queer
pull
towards
the
tender
and
soft
,
revealed
by
an
inclination
toward
both
feelings
and
floral
prints
.
The
tenderqueer
hashtag
leads
to
text
posts
about
vulnerability
,
coping
,
and
feelings
,
and
selfies
of
queer
and
non
-
binary
people
,
often
those
with
pastel
hair
and
/
or
dapper
outfits
.
The
soft
femme
hashtag
yields
more
,
and
more
varied
,
results
,
but
hosts
a
robust
sample
of
shimmery
pink
outfits
,
florals
,
and
pastel
makeup
.
In
particular
,
the
soft
femme
tag
led
me
to
artists
like
Starchild
Stela
,
whose
art
combines
hyper
-
feminine
imagery
like
baby
animals
,
bows
,
and
doll
-
like
figures
with
statements
like
,
“
non
-
binary
and
bitter
”
or
,
“
no
pity
for
rapists
.
”
Like
Pitman
’
s
suggested
approach
,
Stela
holds
nothing
back
,
their
messages
are
direct
and
honest
—
but
delivered
in
a
pretty
,
feminized
vehicle
.
The
aforementioned
Mathis
and
Alok
Vaid
-
Menon
are
other
non
-
binary
artists
that
are
well
known
for
embracing
vulnerability
.
Vaid
-
Menon
’
s
epic
selfies
are
often
captioned
with
candid
descriptions
of
the
transmisogyny
they
are
targeted
by
,
that

Their
Instagram
accounts
also
showcase
contemporary
queer
aesthetics
that
match
those
seen
on
Tumblr
.
It
is
not
merely
coincidental
that
pastel
-
hued
hair
became
popular
alongside
the
impulse
to
get
real
about
our
trauma
and
mental
illness
,
to
be
honest
about
the
emotional
toll
of
the
oppressive
structures
we
live
in
,
or
to
call
ourselves
“
tender
”
and
“
soft
.
”
Softness
is
both
aesthetic
and
political
,
and
aesthetics
are
never
separate
from
politics
.
That
softness
often
looks
pink
and
flouncy
,
and
feels
vulnerable
and
emotional
—
in
other
words
,
that
softness
is
feminized
—
is
not
merely
coincidental
either
.
The
association
of
vulnerability
with
femininity
and
womanhood
is
part
of
what
makes
it
so
uncomfortable
to
a
patriarchal
society
.
The
turn
to
softness
,
then
,
is
an
affront
to
patriarchal
rule
.
It
is
evidence
that
we
are
losing
patience
with
the
primacy
of
the
individual
,
with
the
fiction
of
independence
.
We
are
collapsing
under
the
pressure
to
be
chill
,
to
be
detached
—
from
both
each
other
and
our
own
humanity
.
We
’
re
using
what
has
been
feminized
to
chase
out
these
hollow
masculinist
principles
that
do
not
represent
us
or
serve
us
.
Feminists
and
queers
have
always
resisted
problematic
and
oppressive
mainstream
norms
—
it
is
their
raison
d
’
être
,
after
all
.
They
have
long
been
ready
to
supplant
masculinist
perspectives
for
feminist
and
femme
ones
,
to
reconsider
kinship
and
insist
that
how
we
relate
to
each
other
matters
,
indeed
,
to
admit
that
“
the
personal
is
political
.
”
Femme
politics
in
particular
are
about
reclaiming
and
revaluing
what
has
been
discarded
and
dismissed
for
being
feminine
.
The
turn
to
softness
extends
this
political
impulse
by
reclaiming
and
revaluing
that
which
is
still
seen
as
too
mushy
and
too
much
:
emotions
,
interdependence
,
and
caring
—
about
anything
.
The
number
of
likes
and
followers
steadily
accumulating
around
“
abrasively
feminine
”
and
“
aggressively
vulnerable
”
content
suggests
the
currency
of
such
an
approach
.
Maybe
someone
else
’
s
crying
selfie
makes
you
feel
less
weird
about
crying
;
maybe
someone
else
’
s
description
of
their
mental
illness
symptoms
helps
you
seek
therapy
for
your
own
;
maybe
someone
else
’
s
account
of
harassment
pushes
you
to
engage
with
others
more
thoughtfully
;
maybe
sharing
these
posts
among
friends
helps
us
start
important
conversations
,
helps
us
learn
to
care
and
advocate
for
each
other
better
,
helps
us
realize
that
we
’
re
not
alone
—
and
,
importantly
,
that
if
we
’
re
not
alone
,
then
maybe
it
’
s
not
us
,
maybe
it
’
s
the
system
.
This
is
the
critical
aspect
that
gets
skipped
over
in
the
rush
to
capitalize
on
the
cultural
turn
to
softness
.
Softness
is
not
“
showing
up
”
as
a
temporary
,
band
-
aid
solution
for
superficial
pain
,
it
is
showing
up
,
hoping
to
transform
others
and
the
entire
socio
-
political
terrain
with
our
radical
honesty
and
vulnerability
.
In
its
queer
and
feminist
context
,
softness
is
the
place
from
which
we
can
build
better
political
principles
,
the
place
from
which
we
can
build
a
better
world
.
The
turn
to
softness
has
ushered
in
new
political
sensibilities
.
We
’
re
no
longer
interested
in
pretending
we
can
live
without
each
other
,
or
pretending
we
don
’
t
feel
pain
.
Softness
’
possibilities
—
like
queer
femme
healer
Dacia
Holliday
’
s
promise
that
“
we
get
to
heal
this
lifetime
”
—
are
appealing
,
so
appealing
that
even
the
mainstream
wants
to
explore
them
.
In
short
,
the
feminists
and
queers
are
winning
the
culture
wars
,
if
not
the
political
ones
(
at
least
,
not
yet
)
,
with
superstars
like
Ariana
Grande
and
corporations
like
Wonder
Bread
the
often
unlikely
ambassadors
.

Significance
of
Construction

softness
The
Construction
of
softness
in
Kavyashastra
emphasizes
the
use
of
gentle
phonemes
that
avoid
conjunct
consonants
,
fostering
a
delicate
expression
in
language
.
This
concept
encompasses
both
the
stylistic
expression
of
tender
qualities
and
a
poetic
structure
specifically
designed
to
create
a
soft
sound
.
By
focusing
on
these
gentle
elements
,
the
Construction

enhances
the
overall
emotional

works

Ancient
and
medieval
compatibilism
Compatibilism
,
as
the
name
suggests
,
is
the
view
that
the
existence
of
free
will
and
moral
responsibility
is
compatible
with
the
truth
of
determinism
.
In
most
cases
,
compatibilists
(
also
called
“
soft
”
determinists
)
attempt
to
achieve
this
reconciliation
by
subtly
revising
or
weakening
the
commonsense
notion
of
free
will
.
Compatibilism
has
an
ancient
history
,
and
many
philosophers
have
endorsed
it
in
one
form
or
another
.
In
Book
III
of
the
Nichomachean
Ethics
,
Aristotle
(
384
–
322
bce
)
wrote
that
humans
are
responsible
for
the
actions
they
freely
choose
to
do
—
i
.
e
.
,
for
their
voluntary
actions
.
While
acknowledging
that
“
our
dispositions
are
not
voluntary
in
the
same
sense
that
our
actions
are
,
”
Aristotle
believed
that
humans
have
free
will
because
they
are
free
to
choose
their
actions
within
the
confines
of
their
natures
.
In
other
words
,
humans
are
free
to
choose
between
the
(
limited
)
alternatives
presented
to
them
by
their
dispositions
.
Moreover
,
humans
also
have
the
special
ability
to
mold
their
dispositions
and
to
develop
their
moral
characters
.
Thus
,
humans
have
freedom
in
two
senses
:
they
can
choose
between
the
alternatives
that
result
from
their
dispositions
,
and
they
can
change
or
develop
the
dispositions
that
present
them
with
these
alternatives
.
One
might
object
that
the
capacity
for
self
-
examination
and
reflection
presupposed
by
this
kind
of
freedom
implies
the
existence
of
something
in
humans
that
is
outside
the
causal
order
.
If
this
is
so
,
then
Aristotle
’
s
compatibilism
is
really
a
disguised
form
of
libertarianism
.
For
medieval
Scholastic
philosophers
,
free
will
was
a
theological
problem
.
If
God
is
the
prime
mover
—
the
first
cause
of
all
things
and
events
in
the
universe
,
including
human
actions
—
and
if
the
universe
is
deterministic
,
then
it
seems
to
follow
that
humans
never
act
freely
.
How
can
humans
do
other
than
what
God
has
caused
them
to
do
?
How
then
can
they
be
morally
responsible
for
their
actions
?
An
analogous
problem
obtains
regarding
God
’
s
omniscience
:
if
God
,
being
omniscient
,
has
foreknowledge
of
every
choice
that
humans
make
,
how
can
humans
choose
other
than
what
God
knows
they
will
choose
?
St
.
Augustine
of
HippoSt

Augustine

painting
by
Lippo
Memmi
,
early
14th
century
;
in
the
Pushkin
State
Museum
of
Fine
Arts
,
Moscow
.
In
the
late
4th
and
early
5th
centuries
,
St
.
Augustine
played
a
key
role
in
combining
Greek
philosophy
with
Christianity
;
his
attempts
to
reconcile
human
freedom
with
Christian
notions
such
as
divine
foreknowledge
are
still
cited
by
theologians
.
According
to
Augustine
,
God
—
a
perfect
,
omnipotent
,
and
omniscient
being
—
exists
outside
the
realm
of
time
.
Temporal
directionality
does
not
exist
for
God
,
as
it
does
for
humans
.
Hence
,
it
makes
no
sense
to
attribute
foreknowledge
of
human
choices
to
God
.
Nearly
a
millennium
later
,
St
.
Thomas
Aquinas
(
1225
–
74
)
grappled
with
the
same
problems
.
Like
Augustine
,
he
lived
during
a
major
turning
point
in
Western
intellectual
history
,
when
the
relationship
between
philosophy
and
religion
was
being
freshly
examined
and
recast
.
In
his
Summa
theologiae
(
1265
/
66
–
73
)
,
Aquinas
wrote
that
if
humans
do
not
have
free
will
,
all
“
counsels
,
exhortations
,
commands
,
prohibitions
,
rewards
,
and
punishments
would
be
in
vain
”
;
such
a
conclusion
is
simply
inconceivable
.
In
response
to
the
apparent
conflict
between
freedom
and
God
’
s
role
as
the
prime
mover
of
human
wills
,
Aquinas
claimed
that
God
is
in
fact
the
source
of
human
freedom
.
This
is
because
God
moves
humans
“
in
accordance
with
our
voluntary
natures
.
”
Just
as
by
moving
natural
causes
God
does
not
prevent
their
acts
being
natural
,
so
by
moving
voluntary
causes
He
does
not
deprive
their
actions
of
being
voluntary
.
Because
humans
are
created
by
God
,
their
wills
are
naturally
in
harmony
with
his
.
Thus
,
God
’
s
role
as
prime
mover
need
not
get
in
the
way
of
free
agency
.
Modern
compatibilism
Following
the
rediscovery
of
Classical
learning
during
the
Renaissance
,
philosophers
sympathetic
to
compatibilism
shifted
their
focus
from
the
divine
back
to
the
individual
.
The
English
philosopher
Thomas
Hobbes
(
1588
–
1679
)
argued
that
the
only
condition
necessary
for
free
will
and
moral
responsibility
is
that
there
be
a
connection
between
one
’
s
choices
and
one
’
s
actions
.
In
his
Leviathan
(
1651
)
,
he
asserted
that
desire
,
or
inclination
to
do
.
”
If
people
are
able
to
do
the
things
they
choose
,
then
they
are
free
.
The
Scottish
Enlightenment
philosopher
David
Hume
(
1711
–
76
)
,
another
staunch
compatibilist
,
maintained
that
the
apparent
incompatibility
between
determinism
and
free
will
rests
on
a
confusion
about
the
nature
of
causation
.
Causation
is
a
phenomenon
that
humans
project
onto
the
world
,
he
believed
.
To
say
that
one
thing
(
A
)
is
the
cause
of
another
thing
(
B
)
is
nothing
more
than
to
say
that
things
like
A
have
been
constantly
conjoined
with
things
like
B
in
experience
and
that
an
observation
of
a
thing
like
A
inevitably
brings
to
mind
the
idea
or
expectation
of
a
thing
like
B
.
There
is
nothing
in
nature
itself
that
corresponds
to
the
“
necessary
connection
”
thought
to
exist
between
two
things
that
are
causally
related
.
Since
there
is
just
this
kind
of
regularity
between
human
choices
on
the
one
hand
and
human
actions
on
the
other
,
it
follows
that
human
actions
are
caused
by
human
choices
,
and
this
is
all
that
is
needed
for
free
will
.
As
Hume
claimed
in
his
Enquiry
Concerning
Human
Understanding
(
1748
)
,
“
By
liberty
we
can
only
mean
a
power
of
acting
or
not
acting
,
according
to
the
determinations
of
the
will
.
”
The
British
philosopher
John
Stuart
Mill
(
1806
–
73
)
was
the
major
champion
of
compatibilism
in
the
19th
century
.
He
proposed
that
a
person
is
free
when
“
his
habits
or
his
temptations
are
not
his
masters
,
but
he
theirs
.
”
Unfree
people
,
in
contrast
,
are
those
who
obey
their
desires
even
when
they
have
good
reasons
not
to
.
Mill
’
s
position
is
situated
at
an
interesting
turning
point
in
compatibilist
thinking
.
It
echoes
Kant
in
its
reliance
on
reason
as
the
vehicle
of
freedom
,
but
it
also
anticipates
contemporary
compatibilism
in
its
notion
that
a
free
person
is
one
whose
internal
desires
are
not
at
odds
with
reason
.
In
his
Ethical
Studies
(
1876
)
,
Mill
’
s
countryman
F
.
H
.
Bradley
(
1846
–
1924
)
argued
that
neither
compatibilism
nor
libertarianism
comes
close
to
justifying
what
he
called
the
“
vulgar
notion
”
of
moral
responsibility
.
Determinism
does
not
allow
for
free
will
because
it
implies
that
humans
are
never
the
ultimate
originators
of
their
actions
.
Indeterminism
does
no
better
,
for
it
can
imply
only
that
human
decisions
are
completely
random
.
Yet
it
is
intuitively
obvious
,
according
to
Bradley
,
that
humans
have
free
will
,
and
no
philosophical
argument
in
the
world
will
convince
anyone
otherwise
.
He
thus
advocated
a
return
to
common
sense
.
Given
that
the
philosophical
theory
of
determinism
necessarily
conflicts
with
people
’
s
deep
-
rooted
moral
intuitions
,
it
is
better
to
abandon
the
former
rather
than
the
latter
.
Contemporary
compatibilism
Notwithstanding
Bradley
’
s
argument
,
compatibilism
remained
popular
among
20th
-
century
thinkers
.
The
Cambridge
philosopher
G
.
E
.
Moore
(
1873
–
1958
)
attempted
to
reconcile
determinism
and
free
will
through
a
conditional
analysis
of
freedom
.
To
say
that
one
has
acted
freely
,
according
to
Moore
,
is
simply
to
say
that
“
I
should
”
have
acted
otherwise
“
if
I
had
chosen
”
to
do
so
,
or
“
if
I
had
performed
a
certain
act
of
will
,
I
should
have
done
something
which
I
did
not
do
.
”
The
fact
that
one
may
not
have
been
in
a
position
to
choose
otherwise
does
not
undermine
one
’
s
free
agency
.
But
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
one
could
have
done
otherwise
?
In
“
Freedom
and
Necessity
”
(
1946
)
,
A
.
J
.
Ayer
(
1910
–
89
)
maintained
that
“
to
say
that
I
could
have
acted
otherwise
is
to
say
that
I
should
have
acted
otherwise
if
I
had
so
chosen
.
”
The
ability
to
do
otherwise
means
only
that
if
the
past
had
been
different
,
one
might
have
chosen
differently
.
This
is
obviously
a
very
weak
notion
of
freedom
,
for
it
implies
that
a
choice
or
action
can
be
free
even
though
it
is
completely
determined
by
the
past
.
It
is
an
open
question
whether
Ayer
’
s
account
provides
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
intuitive
notion
of
free
will
.
Supporters
maintain
that
this
is
the
only
type
of
freedom
worth
wanting
,
while
detractors
believe
it
does
not
come
close
to
providing
the
kind
of
free
agency
that
humans
desire
,
in
part
because
it
does
not
imply
that
humans
are
morally
responsible
for
their
“
free
”
actions
.
Other
contemporary
compatibilists
have
attacked
the
hard
determinist
’
s
argument
at
a
different
juncture
.
In
an
influential
paper
,
“
Alternate
Possibilities
and
Moral
Responsibility
”
(
1969
)
,
the
American
philosopher
Harry
Frankfurt
questioned
whether
the
ability
to
do
otherwise
is
truly
necessary
for
freedom
.
Suppose
that
John
is
on
his
way
to
a
voting
booth
and
is
undecided
about
whether
to
vote
for
candidate
A
or
candidate
B
.
Unbeknownst
to
him
,
an
evil
neuroscientist
has
implanted
in
John
’
s
brain
a
device
that
will
,
if
required
,
fire
a
signal
that
forces
John
to
vote
for
candidate
B
.
But
John
decides
to
vote
for
candidate
B
on
his
own
,
so
the
device
turns
out
to
be
unnecessary
.
The
device
does
not
fire
,
so
John
acts
freely
.
But
John
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
:
if
he
had
shown
the
slightest
inclination
toward
candidate
A
,
the
neuroscientist
’
s
device
would
have
made
him
change
his
mind
.
This
“
Frankfurt
-
style
”
counterexample
has
proved
to
be
quite
powerful
in
contemporary
debates
about
free
will
.
It
demonstrates
that
being
able
to
do
otherwise
is
not
necessary
for
free
agency
.
If
the
ability
to
do
otherwise
is
not
necessary
,
what
is
?
Like
Hobbes
and
Hume
,
Frankfurt
locates
freedom
solely
within
the
self
.
In
“
Freedom
of
the
Will
and
the
Concept
of
a
Person
”
(
1971
)
,
he
proposed
that
having
free
will
is
a
matter
of
identifying
with
one
’
s
desires
in
a
certain
sense
.
Suppose
that
Jack
is
a
drug
addict
who
wants
to
reform
.
He
has
a
first
-
order
desire
for
a
certain
drug
,
but
he
also
has
a
second
-
order
desire
not
to
desire
the
drug
.
Although
Jack
does
not
want
his
first
-
order
desire
to
be
effective
,
he
acts
on
it
all
the
same
.
Because
of
this
inner
conflict
,
Jack
is
not
a
free
agent
.
Now
consider
Jack
’
s
friend
Jill
,
who
is
also
a
drug
addict
.
Unlike
Jack
,
Jill
has
no
desire
to
reform
.
She
has
a
first
-
order
desire
for
a
certain
drug
and
a
second
-
order
desire
that
her
first
-
order
desire
be
effective
.
She
feels
no
ambivalence
at
all
about
her
drug
addiction
;
not
only
does
she
want
the
drug
,
but
she
also
wants
to
want
the
drug
.
Jill
identifies
with
her
first
-
order
desire
in
a
way
that
Jack
does
not
,
and
therein
lies
her
freedom
.
In
“
Freedom
and
Resentment
”
(
1962
)
,
the
British
philosopher
P
.
F
.
Strawson
(
1919
–
2006
)
introduced
an
influential
version
of
compatibilism
grounded
in
human
psychology
.
Strawson
observed
that
people
display
emotions
such
as
resentment
,
anger
,
gratitude
,
and
so
on
in
response
to
the
actions
of
others
.
He
argued
that
holding
agents
morally
responsible
for
their
actions
is
nothing
more
than
having
such
feelings
,
or
“
reactive
attitudes
,
”
toward
them
.
The
question
of
whether
the
agents
act
freely
matters
only
insofar
as
it
affects
the
feelings
toward
them
that
others
may
have
;
apart
from
this
,
freedom
is
beside
the
point
.
Moreover
,
because
people
cannot
help
but
feel
reactive
attitudes
,
no
matter
how
much
they
may
try
not
to
,
they
are
justified
in
having
them
,
whatever
the
truth
or
falsity
of
determinism
.
(
This
is
not
to
say
that
the
specific
reactive
attitude
a
person
may
have
on
a
given
occasion
—
of
blind
rage
as
opposed
to
mere
annoyance
,
for
example
—
is
always
justified
.
)
Yet
it
is
far
from
clear
that
people
are
always
justified
in
having
reactive
attitudes
.
Pertinent
information
can
drastically
change
one
’
s
feelings
toward
an
agent
.
For
example
,
one
might
become
less
angry
with
a
driver
who
ran
over
a
cat
if
one
discovers
that
the
driver
was
rushing
to
the
hospital
with
a
desperately
ill
child
.
One
may
even
lose
the
anger
altogether
.
Given
the
enormous
influence
that
everyday
factual
information
has
over
what
reactive
attitudes
people
have
and
whether
they
even
have
them
,
it
seems
unwise
to
treat
them
as
accurate
barometers
of
moral
responsibility
.
Conclusion
Although
the
central
issues
involved
in
the
problem
of
free
will
and
moral
responsibility
have
remained
the
same
since
ancient
times
,
the
emphasis
of
the
debate
has
changed
greatly
.
Contemporary
compatibilists
in
the
vein
of
Frankfurt
and
Strawson
tend
to
argue
that
moral
responsibility
has
little
if
anything
to
do
with
determinism
,
since
it
arises
from
people
’
s
desires
and
attitudes
rather
than
from
the
causal
origins
of
their
actions
.
Humans
may
not
be
free
to
as
great
an
extent
as
the
intuitive
notion
of
free
will
suggests
,
but
there
is
no
other
freedom
to
be
had
.
Addressing
the
problem
of
free
will
and
moral
responsibility
requires
establishing
guidelines
for
holding
people
accountable
,
not
lunging
after
some
impossible
notion
of
free
will
.
Contemporary
libertarians
in
the
vein
of
Chisholm
,
on
the
other
hand
,
continue
to
maintain
that
moral
responsibility
requires
a
certain
kind
of
robust
free
will
that
compatibilism
does
not
allow
for
.
Their
prime
concern
is
to
untangle
the
metaphysical
issues
underlying
the
intelligibility
objection
and
to
make
room
for
free
will
in
an
indeterministic
world
.
How
much
of
human
behaviour
is
determined
by
past
events
,
and
how
much
does
this
matter
—
if
it
does
matter
—
for
free
will
and
moral
responsibility
?
In
the
end
,
the
important
question
may
be
not
whether
the
universe
is
deterministic
or
indeterministic
but
whether
one
is
willing
to
accept
a
definition
of
free
will
that
is
much
weaker
than
intuition
demands
.

the

Fiber

Texture
The
concept
of
texture
pertains
to
the
characteristics
of
a
fabric
'
s
surface
and
can
be
discerned
through
both
visual
and
tactile
perceptions
.
The
texture
of
a
fabric
may
be
either
smooth
or
rough
.
As
natural
fibers
are
characterized
by
inherent
variations
,
they
tend
to
imbue
fabrics
with
greater
texture
compared
to
their
synthetic
or
manufactured
counterparts
.
The
texture
of
a
fabric
is
also
greatly
influenced
by
factors
such
as
yarn
type
,
finishing
techniques
,
and
Surface
contour
The
surface
contour
of
the
fiber
characterizes
its
outer
surface
along
its
shaft
and
may
be
rough
,
smooth
,
scaly
,
serrated
,
convoluted
,
or
striated
,
all
of
which
contribute
to
the
friction

'
s
feel
is
subjective
.
Perceptions
of
different
people
may
differ
.
Skillful
assessment
may
require
experience
in
the
handling
of
different
fabrics
.
Thermal
conductivity
also
plays
a
role
in
how
different
fabrics
feel
.
*
Cotton
,
linen
,
and
rayon
are
good
conductors
of
heat
.
The
heat
from
the
finger
may
be
lost
on
touching
while
judging
.
Thus
,
these
fibers
"
feel
cool
to
the
touch
.
"
*
Wool
feels
warm
as
it
is
not
a
good
conductor
of
heat
.
The
heat
is
not
lost
when
someone
puts
his
/
her
finger
on
the
fabric
of
wool
,
it
remains
there
and
that
is
why
the
wool
feels
warm
.
Wool
has
elasticity
and
is
springy
as
well
.

The
words
we
choose
to
use
carry
significant
weight
.
However
,
the
tone
of
voice
,
with
which
we
deliver
these
words
,
often
holds
even
more
power
.
It
can
transform
a
simple
‘
hello
’
,
from
a
warm
greeting
,
to
a
cold
acknowledgment
.
The
tone
of
voice
conveys
emotion
,
intent
,
and
personality
,
making
it
a
crucial
aspect
of
both
verbal
and
written
communication
.
To
better
appreciate
the
intricacies
of
tone
,
we
have
compiled
a
list
of
words
that
can
be
used
to
describe
it
,
helping
both
readers
,
and
writers
,
refine
their
communication
skills
.

How
To
describe
tone
of
voice
Describing
the
tone
of
voice
is
all
about
capturing
the
emotional
quality
or
character
of
spoken
,
or
written
,
communication
.
Tone
conveys
the
speaker
or
writer
’
s
attitude
toward
the
subject
and
their
audience
.
Here
’
s
a
comprehensive
approach
to
describing
the
tone
of
voice
:
*
Listen
or
Read
Actively
:
Begin
by
paying
close
attention
to
what
’
s
being
said
(
or
written
)
and
how
it
’
s
being
expressed
.
Listen
for
vocal
nuances
like
pitch
,
volume
,
and
pacing
.
In
written
form
,
pay
attention
to
word
choice
,
sentence
structure
,
and
punctuation
.
*
Identify
the
Emotional
Quality
:
Think
about
the
emotions
or
attitudes
that
are
being
expressed
.
Is
the
speaker
joyful
,
sarcastic
,
somber
,
excited
,
etc
.
?
*
Consider
Context
:
Understanding
the
context
can
help
in
determining
tone
.
A
formal
business
setting
might
have
a
professional
and
serious
tone
,
while
a
casual
chat
among
friends
could
be
more
relaxed
and
jovial
.
*
Examine
Word
Choices
:
Specific
words
carry
connotations
that
can
set
the
tone
.
For
instance
,
‘
lamented
’
has
a
sadder
connotation
than
simply
‘
said
.
’
*
Look
for
Literary
Devices
(
for
written
content
)
:
Literary
techniques
like
metaphors
,
alliteration
,
and
hyperbole
can
provide
clues
about
the
tone
.
*
Check
for
Punctuation
(
for
written
content
)
:
Exclamation
points
might
indicate
excitement
or
urgency
,
while
ellipses
can
suggest
hesitation
or
uncertainty
.
*
Reflect
on
the
Intended
Audience
:
A
speech
or
piece
written
for
teenagers
might
have
a
different
tone
,
than
one
intended
for
senior
citizens
.
*
Compare
and
Contrast
:
Sometimes
,
it
helps
to
contrast
the
tone
with
its
opposite
to
make
it
clearer
.
For
instance
,
if
you
’
re
not
sure
if
a
tone
is
optimistic
,
think
about
whether
it
sounds
pessimistic
.
*
Be
Specific
:
Instead
of
simply
saying
the
tone
is
‘
positive
,
’
you
might
describe
it
as
‘
enthusiastic
,
’
‘
elated
,
’
or
‘
hopeful
.
’
*
Consider
the
Purpose
:
What
is
the
speaker
or
writer
trying
to
achieve
?
Are
they
trying
to
persuade
,
inform
,
entertain
,
or
express
?
The
tone
can
provide
clues
.
Recognizing
and
understanding
these
various
tones
can
enhance
our
interpretation
of
spoken
or
written
messages
.
They
can
help
decode
the
intent
behind
the
words
,
offering
a
richer
understanding
of
the
message
being
conveyed
.

Abstract
:
We
introduce
a
new
measure
of
the
structure
of
a
liquid
which
is
the
softness
of
the
mean
-
field
potential
developed
by
us
earlier
.
We
find
that
this
softness
is
sensitive
to
small
changes
in
the
structure
.
We
then
study
its
correlation
with
the
supercooled
liquid
dynamics
.
The
study
involves
a
wide
range
of
liquids
(
fragile
,
strong
,
attractive
,
repulsive
,
and
active
)
and
predicts
some
universal
behaviours
like
the
softness
is
linearly
proportional
to
the
temperature
and
inversely
proportional
to
the
activation
barrier
of
the
dynamics
with
system
dependent
proportionality
constants
.
We
write
down
a
master
equation
between
the
dynamics
and
the
softness
parameter
and
show
that
indeed
the
dynamics
when
scaled
by
the
temperature
and
system
dependent
parameters
show
a
data
collapse
when
plotted
against
softness
.
The
dynamics
of
fragile
liquids
show
a
strong
softness
dependence
whereas
that
of
strong
liquids
show
a
much
weaker
softness
dependence
.
We
also
connect
the
present
study
with
the
earlier
studies
of
softness
involving
machine
learning
(
ML
)
thus
providing
a
theoretical
framework
for
understanding
the
ML
results
.

Disclaimer
:
I
'
m
no
expert
-
this
is
really
a
question
for
the
analysts
and
historians
of
mathematics
.
As
far
as
I
know
,
the
terminology
came
into
existence
in
the
early
20th
century
distinguish
the
classical
"
calculus
"
type
analysis
(
hard
analysis
)
from
the
new
point
set
topology
/
functional
analysis
approach
(
soft
analysis
)
.
A
hard
analytic
argument
uses
a
direct
calculation
or
construction
of
an
exact
estimate
bounds
of
specific
function
or
function
types
to
prove
a
statement
.
A
soft
analytic
arguement
uses
the
general
topological
or
geometric
properties
of
a
space
in
which
a
function
or
function
class
is
defined
to
prove
a
result
indirectly
without
a
precisely
calculated
"
bound
"
.
For
example
,
the
fact
that
the
Cantor
set
has
measure
zero
is
a
"
hard
"
analytic
arguement
;
it
uses
an
epsilon
-
delta
arguement
to
show
the
limit
of
the
sequence
of
"
slices
"
of
the
lengths
of
it
'
s
component
intervals
on
the
real
line
converges
to
0
.
An
example
of
a
"
soft
"
analytic
arguement
:
(
IVT
)
Let
$
f
$
be
a
continuous
function
defined
on
a
connected
subset
of
the
real
line
i
.
e
.
an
interval
with
a
well
defined
least
upper
bound
and
greatest
lower
bound
.
Then
the
function
is
defined
at
every
point
inbetween
the
lub
and
the
glb
.
A
soft
proof
would
be
as
follows
:
Since
an
interval
$
I
$
of
$
\
Bbb
R
$
is
a
connected
subset
of
$
\
Bbb
R
$
and
$
f
$
is
continuous
,
then
$
f
(
I
)
$
is
also
connected
.
Therefore
,
for
every
$
x
\
in
I
$
,
$
f
(
x
)
$
is
in
$
f
(
I
)
$
.
Notice
this
proof
does
not
involve
a
direct
computation
of
bounds
that
proves
$
f
(
x
)
$
is
in
the
image
set
of
$
f
$
(
although
it
certainly
COULD
be
proven
that
way
)
.
Anyway
,
that
'
s
how
Gerald
Itzkowitz
taught
it
to
me
and
I
learned
a
long
time
ago
to
trust
him
on
these
matters
.

I
think
that
your
answer
about
where
the
line
is
drawn
is
good
,
but
I
would
like
to
point
out
that
Sobolev
spaces
are
in
the
realm
of
functional
analysis
but
the
various
embedding
theorems
are
part
of
hard
analysis
.
I
think
that
is
right
.
I
personally
draw
the
line
by
seeing
what
i
find
appealing
and
what
i
don
'
t
.
Also
,
I
think
you
have
to
get
a
bit
deeper
into
the
field
before
you
start
to
see
the
stark
differences
between
the
two
,
in
that
the
examples
that
best
exemplify
it
are
further
down
the
rabbit
hole
.
I
think
you
are
right
about
the
epsilon
delta
stuff
though
.

Well
,
my
knowledge
of
functional
analysis
and
operator
theory
is
still
rather
cursory
,
Sean
-
hence
the
disclaimer
at
the
beginning
.
I
hope
to
rectify
this
by
independent
study
after
getting

I
was
not
able
to
quickly
find
a
reference
,
but
I
remember
that
also
Gaetano
Fichera
described
the
concept
in
the
same
way
in
several
historical
papers
on
the
mathematics
(
in
Italy
)
at
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
.
In
particular
,
in
the
school
of
Mauro
Picone
,
the
“
hard
analysis
”
approach
was
made
concrete
for
example
in
the
emphasis
on
the
explicit
calculation
of
the
constants
involved
in
a
priori
estimates
for
PDEs
,
due
to
their
importance
for
the
construction
of
solutions
.

A
historical
note
.
Hermann
Weyl
mentioned
in
his
talk
"
Felix
Kleins
Stellung
in
der
mathematischen
Gegenwart
"
that
the
dichotomy
of
"
hard
vs
.
soft
analysis
"
had
been
suggested
by
Hardy
.
According
to
Hardy
,
there
is
the
function
theory
of
the
"
hard
,
sharp
,
narrow
"
kind
(
due
to
Bohr
,
Landau
or
Littlewood
)
as
opposed
to
the
"
soft
,
large
,
vague
"
kind
(
due
to
Birkhoff
or
Koebe
)
.
Edit
.
Apparently
,
Hardy
'
s
musings
are
contained
in
his
paper
"
Prolegomena
To

A
thorough
mastery
of
elementary
inequalities
is
to
-
day
one
of
the
first
necessary
qualifications
for
research
in
the
theory
of
functions
;
at
any
rate
,
in
function
theory
of
the
"
hard
,
sharp
,
narrow
"
kind
as
opposed
to
the
"
soft
,
large
,
vague
"
kind
(
I
do
not
use
any
of
these
adjectives
as
words
either
of
praise
or
blame
)
,
the
function
-
theory
of
Bohr
,
Landau
,
or
Littlewood
,
as
opposed
to
the
function
-
theory
of
Birkhoff
or
Koebe
.
It
is
essential
to
anyone
working
in
this
field
to
be
master
both
of
the
main
results
and
of
the
tricks
of
the
trade

To
be

I
am
quite
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
usage
of
the
word
barbarous
in
its
meaning
in
a
language
I
don

understand
(
originally
,
in
a

which
is
not
Greek
,
later
,
not
in
Greek
nor
in
Latin
,
and
so
on
.
.
.
)
could
rise
such
opposition
as
evinced
by
the
upvotes
on
Alex
'
s
initial
comment
-
-
-
which
can
only
be
understood
as
downvotes
on
mine
.
I
don

what
do
people
really

Mariano
,
the
most
likely
reason
people
find
your
comment
downvotable
is
that
barbarous
is
essentially
a
synonym
for
barbaric
in
English
,
i
.
e
.
savage
,
violent
,
cruel
,
brutal
,
uncivilized
,
and
uncultured
.
So
,
the
obvious
interpretation
of
your
statement
is
something
to
the
effect
of
"
wouldn
'
t
it
be
nice
if
someone
translated
that
ugly
German
text
into
a
language
actually
spoken
by
civilized
people
?
"
I
assume
this
was
not
your
intention
,
of
course
!
It
is
also
somewhat
common
for
people
to
say
that
German
is
an
ugly
language
,
probably
a
sentiment
that
has
carried
over
from
the
1940s
.

Consider
the
problem
of
shuffling
a
deck
of
cards
using
some
shuffling
technique
.
One
may
wonder
,
"
If
I
use
this
or
that
shuffling
technique
,
will
I
shuffle
the
deck
?
"
The
problem
can
be
transferred
to
a
question
of
whether
a
particular
finite
Markov
process
converges
to
the
uniform
distribution
or
not
.
Omitting
some
details
,
a
classical
theorem
says
that
,
yes
,
the
process
will
converge
(
to
the
uniform
distribution
)
as
long
as
your
technique
is
reasonable
.
Not
only
that
,
the
convergence
will
eventually
be
exponential
.
This
seems
like
a
useful
theorem
,
but
it
is
actually
rather
deficient
.
The
problem
is
that
your
practical
side
may
wonder
how
many
shuffles
are
required
to
get
the
deck
reasonably
randomized
,
and
this
theorem
doesn
'
t
help
.
So
you
might
say
that
the
original
analysis
was
soft
because
the
result
does
not
help
in
solving
this
quantitative
problem
.
It
tells
you
that
shuffling
is
a
good
idea
,
but
it
doesn
'
t
give
you
any
clue
whether
a
given
technique
could
shuffle
the
deck
in
your
lifetime
or
not
.
A
hard
analysis
would
tell
you
,
for
example
,
"
If
one
defines
reasonably
randomized
by
measure
blahblah
,
then
$
2
\
log
_
2
(
52
)
$
riffle
shuffles
are
sufficient
to
randomize
the
deck
.

I
'
m
not
exactly
sure
what
you
mean
that
this
is
a
probabilistic
argument
.
One
can
phrase
it
in
a
probabilistic
way
,
but
really
it
boils
down
to
a
hard
linear
algebra
problem
since
the
Markov
process
has
finitely
many
states
(
the
measures
here
are
just
vectors
/
functions
)
.
The
statement
that
convergence
happens
is
just
the
Perron
-
Frobenius
Theorem
.
It
is
rather
convenient
to
use
probabilistic
methods
in
the
hard
analysis
of
shuffling
,
though
.
I
think
this
example
rather
clearly
demonstrates
the
struggle
between
generality
and
quantitativeness
.
By
the
way
,
I
myself
happen
to
be
an
analyst
.

Cantor

I
would
expand
the
ternary
Cantor

by
a
factor
of
three
,
note
that
this
makes
two
disjoint
copies
,
and
conclude
the
measure
was
zero
that
way
.
A
"

indeed

That

make
the
point
that

not

hard

;
arguments

do
.
Other

sets
don

t
have
the
exact
structure
to
carry
out
the
enlargement
.
So
you
need
a
"

to
include

,
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
.

To
quote
Andrew
L
:
the
fact
that
the
Cantor
set
has
measure
zero
is
a
"
hard
"
analytic
argument
.
That
is
something
I
contest
in
two
ways
.
Firstly
,
the
fact
is
not
either
"
hard
"
or
"
soft
"
.
Second
,
the
argument
I
sketch
by
enlarging
the
ternary
Cantor
set
is
what
I
'
d
call
"
soft
"
since
it
is
based
on
self
-
similarity
.
As
I
mentioned
,
there
are
other
Cantor
sets
and
self
-
similarity
doesn
'
t
work
directly
for
those
;
and
at
this
point
an
"
epsilon
-
delta
"
or
at
least
"
let
epsilon
>
0
"
argument
may
be
the
obvious
way
to
proceed

Sugar
in
Literature
:
Sweet
Words
and
Metaphors
In
Culture
Sugar
,
with
its
sweet
taste
and
crystalline
structure
,
has
long
been
a
symbol
of
pleasure
,
comfort
,
and
indulgence
.
In
literature
,
sugar
is
often
used
metaphorically
to
evoke
a
sense
of
sweetness
,
richness
,
or
excess
.
From
Shakespearean
sonnets
to
modern
novels
,
the
use
of
sugar
in
literature
adds
layers
of
meaning
and
emotion
to
the
text
.
Let
’
s
explore
how
sugar
has
been
utilized
as
a
literary
device
throughout
history
.
The
Sweetness
of
Words
:
Sugar
as
a
Symbol
of
Love
and
Affection
In
many
works
of
literature
,
sugar
is
used
to
symbolize
love
,
affection
,
and
tenderness
.
Just
as
sugar
adds
sweetness
to
food
,
it
also
adds
warmth
and
comfort
to
relationships
.
In
William
Shakespeare
’
s
sonnets
,
the
poet
often
compares
his
beloved
to
sugar
,
highlighting
their
sweetness
and
desirability
.
For
example
,
in
Sonnet
18
,
Shakespeare
famously
writes
,
“
Shall
I
compare
thee
to
a
summer
’
s
day
?
Thou
art
more
lovely
and
more
temperate
.
”
Here
,
the
comparison
to
a
summer
’
s
day
suggests
the
beauty
and
warmth
of
the
beloved
,
much
like
the
sweetness
of
sugar
.
Similarly
,
in
Jane
Austen
’
s
novel
“
Pride
and
Prejudice
,
”
the
character
Mr
.
Darcy
is
described
as
having
a
“
sweet
disposition
,
”
implying
that
he
is
kind
,
pleasant
,
and
affable
.
This
use
of
sugar
as
a
metaphor
for
personality
traits
adds
depth
to
the
character
and
conveys
a
sense
of
charm
and
likability
.
Indulgence
and
Excess
:
Sugar
as
a
Symbol
of
Luxury
and
Opulence
In
addition
to
symbolizing
love
and
affection
,
sugar
is
often
used
in
literature
to
represent
luxury
,
opulence
,
and
excess
.
In
F
.
Scott
Fitzgerald
’
s
classic
novel
“
The
Great
Gatsby
,
”
the
character
Jay
Gatsby
is
known
for
throwing
extravagant
parties
filled
with
excess
and
indulgence
.
The
abundance
of
sugar
in
the
form
of
cocktails
,
desserts
,
and
confections
at
Gatsby
’
s
parties
symbolizes
the
wealth
and
decadence
of
the
Jazz
Age
.
Furthermore
,
in
Gabriel
Garcia
Marquez
’
s
novel
“
One
Hundred
Years
of
Solitude
,
”
sugar
is
a
recurring
motif
that
represents
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
Buendia
family
.
The
characters
in
the
novel
are
often
seen
indulging
in
sugary
treats
like
candied
fruits
and
desserts
,
highlighting
their
privileged
and
extravagant
lifestyle
.
Bitterness
and
Deception
:
Sugar
as
a
Mask
for
Hidden
Realities
While
sugar
is
commonly
associated
with
sweetness
and
pleasure
,
it
can
also
be
used
in
literature
to
convey
bitterness
,
deception
,
and
hidden
truths
.
In
Truman
Capote
’
s
novella
“
Breakfast
at
Tiffany
’
s
,
”
the
character
Holly
Golightly
is
described
as
having
a
“
sugar
-
coated
”
exterior
that
masks
her
true
emotions
and
vulnerabilities
.
This
use
of
sugar
as
a
metaphor
for
superficiality
and
façade
adds
complexity
to
the
character
and
underscores
the
theme
of
disillusionment
in
the
story
.
Similarly
,
in
the
poem
“
The
Waste
Land
”
by
T
.
S
.
Eliot
,
sugar
is
used
to
symbolize
the
artificiality
and
emptiness
of
modern
life
.
The
speaker
laments
,
“
HURRY
UP
PLEASE
IT
’
S
TIME
,
”
highlighting
the
urgency
and
superficiality
of
societal
expectations
,
much
like
the
fleeting
sweetness
of
sugar
that
ultimately
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
.
In
Conclusion
:
The
Multifaceted
Symbolism
of
Sugar
in
Literature
Throughout
the
history
of
literature
,
sugar
has
been
a
versatile
and
multifaceted
symbol
that
represents
love
,
luxury
,
deception
,
and
more
.
From
Shakespearean
sonnets
to
contemporary
novels
,
the
use
of
sugar
as
a
metaphor
adds
layers
of
meaning
and
emotion
to
the
text
,
enriching
the
reader
’
s
experience
and
understanding
of
the
themes
at
play
.
Just
as
sugar
can
enhance
the
flavor
of
a
dish
,
it
can
also
enrich
the
narrative
of
a
story
,
leaving
a
lasting
impression
on
those
who
savor
its
sweet
words
and
metaphors
.

Element
in
Effective
Communication
Explained
Social
Emotional
Learning
(
SEL
)
plays
a
vital
role
in
our
lives
,
helping
us
develop
the
skills
necessary
to
navigate
relationships
,
manage
emotions
,
and
communicate
effectively
.
Effective
communication
is
at
the
core
of
SEL
,
as
it
allows
us
to
express
ourselves
,
understand
others
,
and
build
meaningful
connections
.
One
often
overlooked
aspect
of
communication
is
tone
of
voice
,
which
can
greatly
impact
the
effectiveness
of
our
interactions
.
In
this
blog
post
,
we
will
explore
why
tone
of
voice
is
important
in
communication
and
how
it
relates
to
Social
Emotional
Learning
.
Understanding
Tone
of
Voice
Tone
of
voice
refers
to
the
way
we
use
our
voice
to
convey
meaning
and
emotions
.
It
encompasses
various
components
,
including
pitch
,
volume
,
rate
of
speech
,
intonation
,
and
emphasis
.
Each
of
these
elements
contributes
to
the
overall
tone
of
our
communication
and
can
greatly
influence
how
our
message
is
received
.
Pitch
Pitch
refers
to
the
highness
or
lowness
of
our
voice
.
A
higher
pitch
is
often
associated
with
excitement
or
enthusiasm
,
while
a
lower
pitch
can
convey
seriousness
or
authority
.
By
varying
our
pitch
,
we
can
add
depth
and
nuance
to
our
communication
.
Volume
Volume
refers
to
the
loudness
or
softness
of
our
voice
.
Speaking
softly
can
create
an
intimate
or
calming
atmosphere
,
while
speaking
loudly
can
convey
confidence
or
assertiveness
.
Adjusting
our
volume
appropriately
can
help
ensure
that
our
message
is
heard
and
understood
.
Rate
of
Speech
The
rate
of
speech
refers
to
how
quickly
or
slowly
we
speak
.
Speaking
too
quickly
can
make
it
difficult
for
others
to
follow
along
,
while
speaking
too
slowly
can
be
perceived
as
boring
or
disengaging
.
Finding
the
right
pace
can
enhance
comprehension
and
maintain
engagement
.
Intonation
Intonation
refers
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
our
voice
as
we
speak
.
It
adds
melody
and
rhythm
to
our
communication
,
helping
to
convey
emotions
and
emphasize
certain
words
or
phrases
.
Mastering
intonation
can
make
our
speech
more
engaging
and
expressive
.
Emphasis
Emphasis
involves
highlighting
specific
words
or
phrases
to
convey
meaning
or
emotions
.
By
placing
emphasis
on
certain
elements
,
we
can
guide
the
listener
’
s
attention
and
ensure
that
our
intended
message
is
understood
.
Emphasis
can
be
achieved
through
changes
in
pitch
,
volume
,
or
intonation
.
The
Role
of
Tone
of
Voice
in
Communication
Tone
of
voice
plays
a
crucial
role
in
communication
,
as
it
can
greatly
impact
how
our
message
is
perceived
and
understood
.
Here
are
two
key
aspects
of
tone
of
voice
:
Conveying
Emotions
and
Attitudes
Our
tone
of
voice
reflects
our
emotions
and
attitudes
,
allowing
others
to
gauge
how
we
feel
about
a
particular
topic
or
situation
.
For
example
,
a
warm
and
enthusiastic
tone
can
convey
happiness
or
excitement
,
while
a
harsh
and
sarcastic
tone
can
convey
anger
or
frustration
.
The
listener
’
s
perception
of
our
emotions
can
influence
their
response
and
the
overall
dynamics
of
the
interaction
.
Moreover
,
the
impact
of
tone
of
voice
on
the
listener
’
s
perception
cannot
be
underestimated
.
The
same
words
spoken
with
different
tones
can
evoke
entirely
different
reactions
.
For
instance
,
a
simple
“
thank
you
”
can
sound
sincere
and
appreciative
or
insincere
and
dismissive
,
depending
on
the
tone
used
.
Being
mindful
of
our
tone
can
help
ensure
that
our
intended
message
aligns
with
how
we
want
it
to
be
received
.
Enhancing
Understanding
and
Clarity
Appropriate
tone
of
voice
is
essential
for
conveying
meaning
and
ensuring
clarity
in
our
communication
.
The
way
we
say
something
can
often
be
just
as
important
as
what
we
say
.
For
example
,
using
a
calm
and
reassuring
tone
when
giving
instructions
can
help
alleviate
anxiety
and
improve
comprehension
.
Conversely
,
a
harsh
or
impatient
tone
can
create
confusion
and
hinder
understanding
.
Additionally
,
tone
of
voice
can
influence
how
our
message
is
interpreted
.
A
sarcastic
tone
,
for
instance
,
can
indicate
that
we
are
joking
or
being
ironic
.
However
,
if
the
listener
is
not
familiar
with
our
usual
tone
,
they
may
interpret
it
as
genuine
and
become
confused
or
offended
.
Being
mindful
of
how
our
tone
may
be
perceived
can
help
us
communicate
more
effectively
and
avoid
misunderstandings
.
Importance
of
Tone
of
Voice
in
Social
Emotional
Learning
Tone
of
voice
is
particularly
important
in
the
context
of
Social
Emotional
Learning
,
as
it
directly
impacts
our
ability
to
build
positive
relationships
and
develop
self
-
awareness
and
self
-
regulation
.
Building
Positive
Relationships
Our
tone
of
voice
has
a
profound
effect
on
our
interpersonal
connections
.
A
warm
and
friendly
tone
can
make
others
feel
comfortable
and
valued
,
fostering
trust
and
rapport
.
Conversely
,
a
cold
or
dismissive
tone
can
create
distance
and
hinder
the
development
of
meaningful
relationships
.
Tone
of
voice
also
plays
a
crucial
role
in
fostering
empathy
and
understanding
.
By
using
a
compassionate
and
empathetic
tone
,
we
can
convey
that
we
genuinely
care
about
the
other
person
’
s
feelings
and
experiences
.
This
can
help
create
a
safe
and
supportive
environment
for
open
and
honest
communication
.
Developing
Self
-
Awareness
and
Self
-
Regulation
Being
aware
of
our
own
tone
of
voice
is
essential
for
developing
self
-
awareness
and
self
-
regulation
.
By
recognizing
how
our
tone
may
impact
others
,
we
can
make
conscious
choices
to
adjust
it
accordingly
.
This
can
help
us
build
stronger
emotional
intelligence
and
improve
our
ability
to
navigate
social
interactions
.
Moreover
,
our
tone
of
voice
can
also
affect
our
personal
well
-
being
and
emotional
regulation
.
Speaking
in
a
calm
and
soothing
tone
,
for
example
,
can
help
us
manage
our
own
stress
and
anxiety
.
By
practicing
self
-
regulation
of
our
tone
,
we
can
create
a
more
positive
and
supportive
internal
dialogue
.
Strategies
for
Improving
Tone
of
Voice
Improving
our
tone
of
voice
is
a
skill
that
can
be
developed
with
practice
and
mindfulness
.
Here
are
two
strategies
that
can
help
:
Active
Listening
and
Mindfulness
Active
listening
involves
paying
attention
not
only
to
what
others
are
saying
but
also
to
our
own
tone
and
its
impact
.
By
being
mindful
of
our
tone
,
we
can
make
conscious
adjustments
to
ensure
that
our
message
is
being
conveyed
effectively
.
Practicing
active
listening
can
also
help
us
better
understand
the
emotions
and
needs
of
others
,
allowing
for
more
empathetic
and
responsive
communication
.
Vocal
Exercises
and
Techniques
Engaging
in
vocal
exercises
and
techniques
can
help
improve
our
control
and
modulation
of
tone
.
Breathing
exercises
,
for
example
,
can
help
us
relax
and
achieve
a
more
balanced
and
controlled
voice
.
Practicing
modulation
and
intonation
can
enhance
our
expressiveness
and
make
our
communication
more
engaging
.
Conclusion
Tone
of
voice
is
a
crucial
element
in
effective
communication
,
with
significant
implications
for
Social
Emotional
Learning
.
By
understanding
and
improving
our
tone
of
voice
,
we
can
enhance
our
ability
to
build
positive
relationships
,
foster
empathy
and
understanding
,
and
develop
self
-
awareness
and
self
-
regulation
.

’
ll
be
equipped
with
valuable
insights
to
enhance
your

and
leave
a
lasting
impression
on
your
listeners
.
Key
Takeaways
*
The
tone
of
voice
is
an
important
factor
in
communication
,
consisting
of
pitch
,
volume
,
and
speed
.
*
It
can
be
adapted
to
suit
personal
relationships
and
professional
settings
to
foster
trust
or
encourage
listeners
.
*
Body
language
,
such
as
facial
expressions
and
gestures
,
should
also
be
considered
for
effective
communication
.
Defining
Tone
of
Voice
in
Communication
The
tone
of
voice
,
a
crucial
aspect
of
communication
,
is
a
potent
tool
in
expressing
sentiments
,
emotions
,
disposition
,
and
objectives
,
including
a
positive
tone
.
In
spoken
communication
,
the
components
of
tone
of
voice
include
:
*
All
other
elements
are
discernible
in
a
script
or
a
print
advertisement
.
However
,
distinguishing
between
written
tone
and
spoken
word
raises
a
question
.
The
distinction
between
written
and
spoken
tone
of
voice
lies
in
their
focus
.
While
written
tone
pertains
to
the
attitude
and
emotional
context
conveyed
through
writing
,
spoken
tone
refers
to
how
someone
sounds
when
they
speak
,
encompassing
their
personality
and
mood
.
For
example
,
Giancarlo
Esposito
’
s
voice
in
Sonos
Voice
Control
exhibits
a
natural
,
consistent
,
and
friendly
style
,
showcasing
a
perfect
blend
of
tone
and
speaking
style
.
Components
of
Tone
of
Voice
The
elements
that
makeup
tone
of
voice
include
pitch
,
volume
,
and
speed
,
which
are
crucial
in
conveying
the
intended
message
and
avoiding
miscommunication
.
For
instance
,
a
high
-
pitched
voice
may
suggest
immaturity
and
childishness
,
while
a
low
pitch
can
convey
authority
or
seriousness
.
The
volume
of
speech
can
be
employed
to
stress
certain
words
or
phrases
,
thereby
aiding
in
the
expression
of
emotion
.
Regulating
the
pace
of
speech
holds
equal
significance
in
shaping
the
tone
of
voice
.
Consciously
moderating
the
speed
can
aid
in
achieving
a
more
informative
tone
and
help
control
emotional
tones
in
communication
.
Slow
speech
can
impart
a
commanding
presence
yet
may
also
demonstrate
a
lack
of
interest
and
lead
to
disengagement
.
On
the
other
hand
,
fast
speech
can
suggest
nervousness
or
enthusiasm
,
significantly
impacting
the
tone
of
voice
and
how
a
person
is
perceived
