Michelle Brnjac surveyed the storefront with growing optimism,
recognizing the potential with each passing glance.

Then came the closer.

“Out back you can still see the outline of the old sign ‘Welcome to
Quality’,” said the newly-arriving baker, referring to 238 Main
Street’s historic Quality Greens. “As soon as I saw quality I knew this
was it. That’s our slogan, where flavour meets quality.”

With that final bit of assurance, Brnjac sealed the deal on relocating
her family-run Eat My Sweets! from a tucked away corner in Streetsville
to its high visibility new digs in downtown Milton.

“It’s a blessing, and quite the learning curve if I’m being honest.
Where we were before there wasn’t a lot of traffic,” said the George
Brown College baking and pastry arts management graduate. “We’re kind
of centre stage here, so we’re learning a new flow and rhythm. It’s
kind of hard to miss us now. It’s a bit of a paradigm shift.”

What remains constant for the relocated bakery – established
seven-and-a-half years ago – is its vision of offering 100 per cent
peanut and tree nut free treats.

And a whole lot of them.

That inspiration was sparked during Brnjac’s post-secondary studies,
when the need for nut-free workplace and school environments was first
gaining widespread attention.

Furthermore, some family friends with nut allergies put a personal
perspective on the matter.

Recalled Brnjac, “Just watching them when we’d go places, they’d always
have to ask (about desserts) and always have to be so cautious. To me,
it felt wrong. They kind of got the short end of the stick.”

Holding firm to the idea that taste doesn’t need to be sacrificed to
ensure safety – viewing this as “putting salt in an open wound” – the
local bakery owner says having a completely nut-free menu isn’t as
challenging as many may believe.

At least from a creative standpoint.

“For a lot of things the nuts are more of an addition or garnish of…
it’s optional,” said Brnjac, whose Croatian and Italian heritage
offered plenty of family influences for her career to come. “In some
cases you need to reinvent the wheel a bit, but it’s not as difficult
as people think.”

Opening Eat My Sweets! after years spent in the event planning food
industry, she and her staff remain vigilant to ensure no traces of
peanuts and tree nuts come in contact with any of their offerings.

That means always being mindful of labels, and switching ingredients
whenever the ‘may contain’ warning comes into play. There’s also the
minimum 24-hour safety net between handling any peanut products and
starting a work shift, to protect those whose allergic reactions are
triggered by inhalation as much as ingestion.

While offering a few cupcakes as an intro point for kids just starting
to explore the world of nut-free desserts, the business focuses more on
a wide variety of brownies, blondies and squares – as well as some more
unique dishes like French galettes.

Custom orders are always available, while seasonal offerings and
home-made jams of Brnjac’s aunt add to the sweet spectrum of choices.

Among the more popular ones are the mixed berry square – which was
initially thought to be only a seasonal addition – and the aptly-named
‘blackout’ brownie.

“It’s kind of a chocolate overload, it’s best to eat it in small
doses,” quipped Brnjac, who’d originally looked to become a chef before
a close call with undercooked chicken in a Grade 11 hospitality class
left her “discombobulated” and readjusting her career path.

Unbeknownst to the Eat My Sweets! owner until considering a new
location earlier this year was the fact that many of her longtime
customers were actually from Milton.

“When I said I was thinking of coming here they said ‘Michelle, you
have no idea how big a base (for nut-free sweets) there is in Milton.
I’m super blessed; everything fell into place at the right time.”
